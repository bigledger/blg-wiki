Every tenant in the Akaun Platform requires different applets for their own operations. Thus, every tenant in the Akaun Platform will be given access to his own unique catalog of applets which are designed for his own use. Next, the Applet Store consists of both public and private catalogs. The details of these catalogs are described below.","42-public-catalog#4.2 Public CatalogÔªø":"Public Catalog Page When the users enter the Applet Store after accepting the terms of use of applets, they will be directed to the Public page that shows all the public catalogs with their associated applets. Public catalogs are catalogs that can be accessed by all parties. These catalogs store applets that are commonly used by all parties to perform their operations. For instance, the screenshot above shows that the MLM Admin applet is an applet under the Public Catalog. Figure 2. Applet Information Additionally, every individual applet in the Applet Store has its own specific icon, name and average user ratings. Next, every individual applet has its tenant code. For example, staging_tenant. The tenant code identifies the tenant to which the applet belongs. This is because some applets are required by many different tenants. For instance, the Cashbook Applet is needed by many tenants to manage their cash book and settlement methods. However, every tenant needs their version of the Cashbook Applet because they would like to store their private data in the applet. Thus, we have Cashbook Applets with different tenant codes in which each tenant code identifies a specific tenant user. Every tenant user can only access the applet which is associated with his tenant code. Apart from that, every individual applet has its rank. The rank type includes OWNER, ADMIN and MEMBER. This is because users with different ranks have different roles in managing and using the applets. For instance, users with the ADMIN and OWNER rank have the read and write access in assigning permissions to other users in using an applet whereas the users with MEMBER rank can only have read access to the permissions in an applet.","43-private-catalog#4.3 Private CatalogÔªø":"Private Catalog Page - Install All Next, when users click on the ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù tab, they will be directed to the page that shows all the private catalogs as shown in the screenshot above. Private Catalogs are catalogs that can only be accessed by users who are given specific permission by the admin. The admin of the Platform Sysadmin Applet can use this applet to assign permission for users to access their catalog of applets in the Applet Store. As mentioned previously, different clients will gain access to their own catalogs in order to use the relevant applets to carry out their particular operations. Thus, the catalogs and applets shown in this page vary by users. Apart from that, a search bar is implemented on every catalog page for users to filter and search their desired applets easily. Users can search for their desired applets by typing the name of the applets in the search bar. The search function will be executed automatically once the users start typing words on the bar. Next, users can click on the ‚ÄúInstall All‚Äù green button to install all the applets in the ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù tab page at once. This can save their time from installing the applets individually.","44-my-applets#4.4 My AppletsÔªø":"Next, when users click on the ‚ÄúMy Applets‚Äù tab, they will be directed to a page that shows all the applets they have installed.","50-installing-applets#5.0 Installing AppletsÔªø":"","51-applet-installation-page#5.1 Applet Installation PageÔªø":"Applet Installation Page When users click on an applet icon in the catalog page, users will be able to read the details of the applet as shown in the screenshot above.

They can also read the description of the applet from the applet page. By doing that, the users can understand the functions of the applet and the mechanism of using the applet. Additionally, they are able to know the type of the applet and the ranking of the applet in the Applet Store. For instance, the Stock Transfer applet shown in the screenshot above is labeled as the Business type applet. It is also ranked as the second top grossing applet, meaning the second top applet that generates the highest profit among all the available applets. Figure 3. Applet Installation Page - Ratings and Reviews Moreover, users are able to see the rating and reviews of each applet in the installation page of the respective applet. Firstly, the platform will calculate and generate the average user ratings of the applet besides showing the statistics of rating in the form of a horizontal bar chart. It also shows the total number of users who have given the rating. Next, users can also read the reviews of other users who comment on the applet. Additionally, users can also write their reviews under the reviews section and update their own reviews from time to time.

One of the essential features is the permission setting for an applet. This is because a client who uses the applets may want to set specific permissions to regulate the access control of his employees in using the applets. Figure 1. Settings Tab Firstly, users can navigate to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab which is located at the bottom left of every opened applet as shown in the screenshot above to configure their applet settings.","61-permission-set#6.1 Permission SetÔªø":"A permission template is a template that consists of one or multiple permission lines. Every permission line refers to a specific defined permission. For example, permission to create internal sales order invoices. A permission set is a permission template in which the permission lines are configured to targets. The target can be a branch, company, or location, depending on the permission template. By doing that, the targets are permitted to perform certain operations. Only users with the ADMIN or OWNER rank in the applet can have read and write access in assigning the permissions to the applet users.

Essentially, KO helps automate reconciliation between issued invoices and received payments, preventing discrepancies in financial records.","when-should-you-configure-a-ko#When Should You Configure a KO?":"Configuring a KO is optional but may be necessary if: The company wants to track payments against invoices in an automated manner.

A critical setup for the company to configure the workflow. Click on the ‚Äò+‚Äô button to begin setup. Server Doc Type Options: Essential for setting up the company‚Äôs workflow, such as configuring the process for purchase orders, converting them into purchase GRNs or invoices, or setting up the sales process (from sales orders to sales invoices). The configuration is based on document types. The user needs to select the server type. Server Type 1 refers to the source document, while Server Type 2 refers to the target document This is an example of a basic knock-off (KO) setup flow for the customer. For instance, when the user creates an invoice, there will be two knock-off options: Sales Order and Sales Quotation. This means that in the Sales Invoice applet, under the KO (knock-off) tab, the user will see two options: Sales Order and Sales Quotation. Users can enable or disable knock-off settings from the main tab page. The KO (knock-off) options depend on the customer configuration and the user‚Äôs needs.

One of the key challenges faced by the client was the lack of customer engagement and personalized ‚Äòtouch‚Äô when executing their marketing activities. No software had been set in place to stay connected with customers and provide convenience for their financing needs. The scope of the project has involved a CRM Application which consists of both Mobile Application and Admin Console. The Mobile application is running on Android and iOS which addresses the needs of multiple car brands. The Admin Console back-office system is a complete package that administers marketing events, promotions, member card privileges and custom messages. It also incorporates other versatile features such as invoice management, audit trail reports, target group management, updating of terms and conditions, and landing pages. In addition to optimising the data exchange between the automotive business and end customers via an implemented CRM app, Wavelet has integrated the software to the current back-end ERP system for the automation of the financial module and invoice management. The system allows the car owner to pay their car loan directly via the app, with the data being pushed directly to the back-end system for further processing. Furthermore, Wavelet serves several largest car servicing and workshop market players in Malaysia. One of the long-served clients is a renowned car servicing centre, established in the 1980s, with a wide network across the country. Servicing more than 15,000 vehicles monthly, the customer owns 20 branches in the Klang Valley and beyond.","the-key-challenges-that-the-customer-had-faced-with-their-previous-system-were#The key challenges that the customer had faced with their previous system were:Ôªø":"Slow deployment for new outlets.

The kitting process/reverse kitting process will apply. 1 Kit (Kit-A) may have A1, A2, A3, A4 child items, which will be deducted from the stock balance, while a Kit-A quantity will also increase by 1 (this constitutes one of the main differences between Kit and a Grouped item). Grouped item is applicable for those cases when an item has dimensions (e.g. size, colour etc). This refers to the grouping of the basic items. For example, T-shirt - Yellow/Blue/Red - size 3/4/5 : When the customer selects a T-shirt, he/she is presented with options (e.g. colours \u0026 sizes).
