  {{< card link="/applets/ledger-and-journal-applet/" title="Ledger and Journal Applet" subtitle="The central engine for creating, managing, and organizing all journal entries and ledger postings." >}}
{{< /cards >}}

**What the Core Applet Does:**

The Ledger and Journal Applet is the heart of the Journal Module - it's where all financial transactions are recorded, organized, and posted to the appropriate accounts. This applet provides:

- **Manual Journal Entry Creation**: Record transactions directly through the journal interface when they don't originate from other applets
- **Automated Journal Posting**: Receive and post journal entries automatically generated by operational applets (sales, purchases, etc.)
- **Ledger Management**: Maintain your chart of accounts and view account balances
- **Sub-Ledger Tracking**: Manage detailed customer, supplier, and asset accounts
- **Transaction History**: Access complete audit trails for all financial events
- **Search and Reporting**: Find and analyze transactions across multiple dimensions

**When You Work Directly in This Applet:**
- Recording bank transactions not captured elsewhere (bank charges, interest income)
- Making adjusting entries (depreciation, accruals, prepayments)
- Recording internal transfers between accounts
- Making correcting entries and reversals
- Recording non-standard transactions (asset disposals, write-offs, provisions)

---

### Shared Applets

The Journal Module is designed to work seamlessly with other BigLedger applets, automating the creation of journal entries from operational transactions.

**How Automation Works:**

Instead of manually creating a journal entry for every sale or purchase, you work in the specialized operational applets. When you complete a transaction in these applets, they automatically generate the corresponding journal entries in the Ledger and Journal Applet.

**Benefits of Automated Journal Creation:**
- **Reduced Errors**: No manual entry means fewer mistakes
- **Time Savings**: Create one sales invoice; journal entries post automatically
- **Consistency**: Same transaction types always create the same journal structure
- **Operational Focus**: Sales team focuses on invoicing; accounting happens automatically
- **Complete Integration**: Operational data and accounting data stay synchronized

### Downstream Integrations

The data captured and organized by the Journal Module is the foundation for all financial analysis and reporting.

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="/applets/financial-reports-applet/" title="Financial Reports Applet" subtitle="Generates key reports like Trial Balance, Profit & Loss, and Balance Sheet." >}}
{{< /cards >}}

**How Journal Data Feeds Financial Reports:**

Every journal entry you create (manually or automatically) updates the ledger accounts. The Financial Reports Applet reads these ledger balances to generate three fundamental financial statements:

**1. Trial Balance**
- **What It Shows**: Complete list of all accounts with their debit and credit balances
- **Data Source**: Current balance of every ledger account from all posted journal entries
- **Purpose**: Verify that total debits = total credits across the entire system
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time - reflects all posted journal entries immediately

*Example:* After posting 500 journal entries in October, the Trial Balance shows:
- Assets (debit balances): Cash $50,000, AR $100,000, Inventory $75,000...
- Liabilities (credit balances): AP $60,000, Loans $150,000...
- Equity (credit balances): Capital $200,000, Retained Earnings $50,000...
- Revenue (credit balances): Sales Revenue $300,000...
- Expenses (debit balances): Salaries $80,000, Rent $20,000, Supplies $15,000...
- Total Debits: $500,000 = Total Credits: $500,000 ✓

**2. Profit & Loss Statement (Income Statement)**
- **What It Shows**: Revenue minus Expenses = Net Profit or Loss
- **Data Source**: Balances from Revenue and Expense ledger accounts only
- **Purpose**: Show business performance over a period (month, quarter, year)
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time - every new sales invoice or expense entry updates the P&L

*Example:* October P&L generated from journal data:
```
Revenue:
  Sales Revenue          $300,000  (from all sales journal entries)
  Service Revenue         $50,000  (from service billing journal entries)
  Total Revenue          $350,000

Cost of Goods Sold:
  Cost of Sales          $150,000  (from inventory cost journal entries)
  Gross Profit           $200,000

Operating Expenses:
  Salaries                $80,000  (from payroll journal entries)
  Rent                    $20,000  (from rent payment journal entries)
  Utilities               $10,000  (from utility bill journal entries)
  Supplies                $15,000  (from supplies purchase journal entries)
  Total Expenses         $125,000

Net Profit               $75,000
```

**3. Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)**
- **What It Shows**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity at a specific date
- **Data Source**: Balances from Asset, Liability, and Equity ledger accounts
- **Purpose**: Show the financial position and solvency of the business
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time - every journal entry affecting assets, liabilities, or equity updates the Balance Sheet

*Example:* October 31 Balance Sheet generated from journal data:
```
ASSETS:
  Current Assets:
    Cash                   $50,000  (from all cash receipt/payment journal entries)
    Accounts Receivable   $100,000  (from sales/payment journal entries)
    Inventory              $75,000  (from purchase/sale journal entries)
    Total Current Assets  $225,000

  Fixed Assets:
    Equipment             $150,000  (from purchase journal entries)
    Less: Depreciation    ($30,000) (from depreciation journal entries)
    Net Fixed Assets      $120,000

  Total Assets            $345,000

LIABILITIES:
  Current Liabilities:
    Accounts Payable       $60,000  (from purchase/payment journal entries)
    Total Liabilities      $60,000

EQUITY:
  Capital                $200,000  (from investment journal entries)
  Retained Earnings       $10,000  (from prior period)
  Current Year Profit     $75,000  (calculated from P&L)
  Total Equity           $285,000

Total Liabilities + Equity $345,000

Assets = Liabilities + Equity ✓
```

**Real-Time Reporting Flow:**

1. **Transaction Occurs**: Sale, purchase, payment, adjustment
2. **Journal Entry Created**: Either manually or auto-generated by operational applet
3. **Ledger Updated**: Journal entry posts to affected ledger accounts
4. **Reports Refresh**: Financial Reports Applet reads updated ledger balances
5. **Instant Visibility**: Current financial position visible immediately

**Drill-Down Capability:**

Financial reports aren't just static numbers - you can drill down to see the underlying detail:

*In Financial Reports Applet:*
1. View October P&L showing "Salaries Expense: $80,000"
2. Click on $80,000 → See list of all journal entries that make up this total
3. Click on any journal entry → View complete transaction details
4. See who created it, when, what document it references
5. Trace back to source (payroll records, timesheets, etc.)

This complete traceability means every number on your financial statements can be verified and explained.

## Key Concepts

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping

The Journal Module is built on the principle of double-entry accounting, where every transaction has an equal and opposite effect on at least two different accounts. This is captured through debits and credits, ensuring that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) always remains in balance.

**Understanding the Fundamentals:**

Double-entry bookkeeping is the foundation of modern accounting. When you record a transaction in the Journal Module, you're not just noting that money moved - you're documenting both where it came from and where it went.

**The Core Rule:**
- Every transaction must have at least two entries
- Total debits must always equal total credits
- If debits don't equal credits, the transaction cannot be saved

**Real-World Examples:**

**Example 1: Receiving Customer Payment**
When a customer pays $5,000 for an outstanding invoice:
- **Debit**: Cash/Bank Account - $5,000 (asset increases)
- **Credit**: Accounts Receivable - $5,000 (asset decreases)
- **Result**: One asset (cash) goes up while another asset (receivables) goes down by the same amount

**Example 2: Paying Monthly Rent**
When you pay $2,000 rent:
- **Debit**: Rent Expense - $2,000 (expense increases)
- **Credit**: Cash/Bank Account - $2,000 (asset decreases)
- **Result**: Your expenses increase (reducing profit) and your cash decreases

**Example 3: Purchasing Equipment on Credit**
When you buy $10,000 worth of equipment and agree to pay later:
- **Debit**: Equipment (Asset) - $10,000 (asset increases)
- **Credit**: Accounts Payable (Liability) - $10,000 (liability increases)
- **Result**: You gain an asset and incur a liability of equal value

**How the Journal Module Enforces This:**

The system has built-in validation to maintain double-entry principles:
- As you add line items, the system calculates total debits and total credits in real-time
- A visual indicator shows whether the transaction is balanced
- The **Create** button remains disabled until debits equal credits
- Error messages clearly indicate the imbalance amount if you try to save

**Why This Matters:**

Double-entry bookkeeping provides multiple benefits:
- **Error Detection**: Immediately identifies when something doesn't add up
- **Complete Picture**: Shows both sides of every transaction (where money came from and where it went)
- **Audit Trail**: Creates a systematic record that can be traced and verified
- **Financial Statement Accuracy**: When all transactions balance, your Balance Sheet and Income Statement will be accurate
- **Fraud Prevention**: Makes it difficult to manipulate records because every change affects multiple accounts

---

### The Journal vs. The Ledger

Understanding the distinction between the journal and the ledger is crucial to effectively using the Journal Module. While they both contain transaction information, they serve fundamentally different purposes and organize data in different ways.

**The Journal: Your Financial Diary**

Think of the journal as the first book of entry - it's a chronological diary of all financial transactions. When a sale, purchase, or payment occurs, it's first recorded in the journal. This provides a detailed, time-stamped audit trail.

**Key Characteristics of the Journal:**
- **Chronological Order**: Transactions are recorded in the order they occur, creating a timeline
- **Complete Transaction Detail**: Each entry shows the full story - date, description, all affected accounts, amounts, and supporting document references
- **Sequential Numbering**: Entries are numbered sequentially (JV-001, JV-002, etc.), creating an unbroken chain
- **Original Entry Point**: This is where financial events first enter your accounting system
- **Question It Answers**: "What happened on this date?" or "When did this transaction occur?"

**Journal Entry Example:**
```
Date: October 28, 2025
Journal No: JV-2025-0847
Description: Payment to ABC Suppliers for office supplies per Invoice #INV-9876
Document Type: Payment Voucher
Document No: PV-1023

Line Items:
  Debit:  Office Supplies Expense    $850.00
  Credit: Cash - Main Bank Account    $850.00
```

This entry tells the complete story in chronological context: what happened (supplies purchase), when (Oct 28), who was involved (ABC Suppliers), and the financial impact (two accounts affected).

---

**The Ledger: Your Financial Organization System**

The ledger is the principal book of accounts. After being recorded in the journal, transaction data is posted to the appropriate accounts in the ledger. The ledger is organized by account (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable, Sales), showing the cumulative balance and history for each one.

**Key Characteristics of the Ledger:**
- **Account-Based Organization**: Groups all transactions by account type, not by date
- **Running Balances**: Shows cumulative balance for each account after every transaction
- **Account-Centric View**: Focuses on "what's happening with this specific account?"
- **Summary Information**: Emphasizes totals and balances rather than transaction narratives
- **Financial Statement Source**: Balance Sheet and Income Statement figures come from ledger balances
- **Question It Answers**: "How much cash do we have?" or "What's our total sales revenue?"

**Ledger Account Example:**
```
Account: Cash - Main Bank Account (GL Code: 1010)
Account Type: Asset

Date          Journal No    Description              Debit      Credit     Balance
Oct 1, 2025   JV-2025-0801  Opening Balance                              $25,000
Oct 5, 2025   JV-2025-0812  Customer payment        $3,500               $28,500
Oct 12, 2025  JV-2025-0823  Rent payment                       $2,000    $26,500
Oct 28, 2025  JV-2025-0847  Office supplies                      $850    $25,650

Current Balance: $25,650 (Debit)
```

This ledger view organizes all cash transactions together, regardless of what type of transaction they were, giving you a clear picture of your cash position.

---

**How They Work Together:**

The journal and ledger work in tandem through a process called **posting**:

**Step 1: Record in Journal**
A transaction occurs (e.g., you make a $3,000 sale). You create a journal entry with:
- Date, description, and document references
- Debit: Accounts Receivable $3,000
- Credit: Sales Revenue $3,000

**Step 2: Post to Ledger (Automatic)**
The Journal Module automatically posts this to the affected ledger accounts:
- The **Accounts Receivable ledger** increases by $3,000
- The **Sales Revenue ledger** increases by $3,000
- Both ledgers now show this transaction in their history

**Step 3: Ongoing Relationship**
- The journal maintains the chronological story
- The ledger maintains the account-based totals
- You can navigate between them (click a journal number in a ledger to see the full journal entry)

**Practical Use Cases:**

**Scenario 1: Customer Questions a Payment**

*Using the Journal:*
- Search by customer name or invoice number
- Find the specific journal entry showing when payment was recorded
- See complete details: date, amount, check number, all in context

*Using the Ledger:*
- Open the customer's sub-ledger (Accounts Receivable - Customer ABC)
- See all transactions with this customer
- View their current balance and complete payment history

**Scenario 2: Month-End Financial Review**

*Using the Journal:*
- Filter by transaction date for the month
- Review all activity chronologically
- Verify completeness of recording
- Check for unusual or missing entries

*Using the Ledger:*
- Review ending balances for all accounts
- Compare to prior month balances
- Identify accounts with unusual activity
- Prepare financial statements from account balances

**Key Takeaway:**

The Journal Module creates the journal entries (the "what and when"), which then automatically update the ledger accounts (the "how much in total"). You need both perspectives:
- **Journal** for audit trails, finding specific transactions, and understanding chronology
- **Ledger** for account balances, financial statements, and understanding financial position

## Core Features

The Journal Module provides end-to-end management of financial transactions through the features of the Ledger and Journal Applet. These features work together to capture, organize, and report on every financial event in your business.

### 1. Journal Transaction Management

The core of the module, where all financial activities are recorded. It provides a complete history of every event, creating a searchable and auditable record.

**What This Feature Does:**

Journal Transaction Management is where your business's financial story is written. Every sale, purchase, payment, receipt, adjustment, and transfer is recorded here first. This creates an unbreakable chain of financial events that can be reviewed, searched, analyzed, and audited.

**Why It Matters:**

Without proper transaction management:
- Financial records become scattered and unreliable
- Audit trails are incomplete or missing
- Finding specific transactions becomes time-consuming
- Compliance becomes difficult or impossible
- Financial reports may be inaccurate

With robust transaction management:
- Every financial event is documented completely
- Transactions can be found in seconds using search
- Audit requirements are automatically satisfied
- Reports are based on complete, accurate data
- Multiple people can work simultaneously without conflicts

#### Detailed Listings: Your Transaction Dashboard

View all transactions with columns for Journal No, Company, Description, Date, Document Type, Status, and Amount.

**Understanding the Listing Page:**

The Journal Transaction listing is your command center for viewing and managing all journal entries. It's designed to give you maximum information at a glance while providing quick access to detailed views.

**Column-by-Column Explanation:**

**Journal No**
- System-generated unique identifier (e.g., JV-2025-0001, JV-2025-0002)
- Sequential numbering creates an audit trail
- Used throughout the system to reference transactions
- Click to open the full transaction detail

*Use Case:* When someone mentions "Journal entry 847," you can search JV-847 and immediately find it.

**Journal No By Company**
- Company-specific numbering if managing multiple entities
- Allows each company to maintain its own sequence
- Example: Company A uses JV-A-001, Company B uses JV-B-001
- Useful for organizations with multiple legal entities

*Use Case:* In a holding company with three subsidiaries, each subsidiary has its own journal number sequence, making it clear which entity each transaction belongs to.

**Description**
- Brief narrative explaining the transaction
- Should be clear enough to understand without opening details
- Examples: "Monthly rent payment - October 2025," "Customer payment - Invoice #5432"
- Good descriptions make searching and reviewing efficient

*Use Case:* Scanning through October's transactions, you see "Rent - October" and immediately know what it is without clicking through.

**Transaction Date**
- The date when the financial event actually occurred
- May differ from when it was entered into the system
- Determines which accounting period the transaction affects
- Critical for period-based reporting

*Use Case:* You entered a transaction on November 1st, but it actually occurred on October 31st. The Transaction Date is October 31st so it appears in October's financial reports.

**Company**
- Which business entity this transaction belongs to
- Essential for multi-company environments
- Each company maintains separate financial records
- Affects which Chart of Accounts is available

*Use Case:* Your organization has three companies. Filtering by "Company B" shows only transactions for that specific legal entity.

**Document Type**
- Classification of the supporting document
- Examples: Invoice, Payment Voucher, Receipt, Credit Note, Journal Voucher
- Helps categorize and filter transactions
- Links to document management systems

*Use Case:* Looking for all customer invoices issued in October, you filter by Document Type: "Customer Invoice" and Transaction Date in October.

**Document No**
- Reference number of the source document
- Creates link to physical or digital documentation
- Examples: INV-5432, RCP-9876, PV-1234
- Essential for audit trail and verification

*Use Case:* A customer disputes an invoice. You search Document No "INV-5432" to find the journal entry, then trace to the original invoice.

**Status**
- Current workflow position of the transaction
- Common statuses:
  - **Draft**: Created but not yet submitted
  - **Pending Approval**: Submitted and awaiting review
  - **Approved**: Reviewed and approved
  - **Rejected**: Not approved, needs revision
  - **Voided**: Cancelled
- Indicates what action is needed next

*Use Case:* Reviewing transactions for approval, you filter by Status: "Pending Approval" to see only those needing your review.

**Posting Status**
- Indicates whether transaction affects the ledger
- **Unposted**: Created but not finalized; can still be edited
- **Posted**: Finalized in the ledger; locked from editing; affects financial statements
- Critical distinction for data integrity

*Use Case:* Month-end close requires all transactions to be Posted. You filter by "Unposted" to find any that still need posting before closing the period.

**Amount**
- Total monetary value of the transaction
- Provides quick view of transaction size
- Useful for sorting (largest to smallest) or filtering (over certain amounts)
- Helps identify high-value transactions needing extra review

*Use Case:* Your approval authority is up to $5,000. You filter for transactions over $5,000 that need manager approval.

**Created Date**
- Timestamp when transaction was first entered
- Different from Transaction Date
- Useful for tracking data entry patterns
- Helps investigate timing issues

*Use Case:* Investigating why October transactions weren't in the month-end report, you notice they were Created on November 2nd (after the report was run) even though Transaction Date was October 30th.

**Updated Date**
- Timestamp of most recent modification
- Helps identify recently changed transactions
- Useful for tracking revision history
- Shows when corrections were made

*Use Case:* After making corrections to several transactions, you sort by Updated Date (newest first) to verify all your changes were saved.

**Interactive Features:**

**Clicking Any Row**
- Opens the complete transaction detail view
- Shows Main tab (header information) and Lines tab (line items)
- Displays all categories, notes, and attachments
- Allows editing if transaction is unposted and you have permission

#### Transaction Creation: Guided Two-Step Process

A guided, two-step process to create new journal entries, first by defining header information (Date, Company, etc.) and then adding debit/credit line items.

**Why Two Steps:**

The Journal Module separates transaction creation into two logical steps because:
1. **Header information** (Main tab) provides context: who, what, when, where
2. **Line items** (Lines tab) provide the accounting detail: which accounts, how much

This separation makes data entry more organized and reduces errors compared to entering everything on one crowded screen.

**Step 1: Main Tab - Transaction Header**

The Main tab captures the overall transaction information - the transaction's "identity card" before you specify the accounting details.

**Required Fields (marked with *):**

**Company***
- Select the legal business entity
- Each company has separate books and financial statements
- Example: Selecting "ABC Corporation" means this transaction belongs to ABC's financial records

*Why It's Required:* Financial records must be kept separate by legal entity for compliance and reporting.

**Branch***
- Specify the physical location or branch
- Enables location-based performance tracking
- Example: "Downtown Branch," "Airport Location," "Warehouse #2"

*Why It's Required:* Allows businesses with multiple locations to track performance by branch for management decisions.

**Ledger***
- Choose which ledger book this records into
- Most businesses use "General Ledger" for all transactions
- Some use specialized ledgers: "Cash Ledger," "Purchase Ledger," "Sales Ledger"

*Why It's Required:* Determines how the transaction is organized and reported in the system.

**Currency***
- Specify the transaction currency
- Example: USD, EUR, GBP, MYR
- System applies exchange rates if different from base currency

*Why It's Required:* Multi-currency businesses need to track transactions in their original currency before conversion.

**Date***
- The actual date the financial event occurred
- May be today, a past date, or (less commonly) a future date
- Must be within an open accounting period

*Why It's Required:* Determines which period the transaction affects; essential for accurate period-based reporting.

**Optional But Important Fields:**

**Reference Number**
- Your internal tracking code
- Examples: Check number (CHK-4523), Wire transfer reference (WT-87654), PO number (PO-2024-0856)
- Makes transactions easy to find and cross-reference

*Best Practice:* Always enter reference numbers to create complete audit trails.

**Server Doc Type**
- Type of document in your document management system
- Examples: "Supplier Invoice," "Customer Receipt," "Payment Voucher"
- Links accounting entry to stored documents

**Server Doc No**
- Specific document identifier in your DMS
- Example: "DMS-2025-5432"
- Creates direct path from journal entry to scanned/digital document

*Together, these create powerful document traceability:* Click on journal entry → See Doc No → Access actual scanned invoice/receipt in document system.

**Description**
- Detailed narrative explaining the transaction
- Should be clear enough for someone else to understand months later
- Include: what happened, with whom, why, document references

*Good Example:* "Payment to XYZ Suppliers for office supplies per Invoice #INV-9876, our PO #PO-2024-0856, Check #4523"

*Poor Example:* "Office payment" (too vague, no references)

**Action Buttons:**

**Reset** (top right)
- Clears all entered data in the form
- Use if you started entering the wrong transaction
- Does not delete anything (just clears the creation form)

**Create** (top right)
- Validates that all required fields are completed
- Saves the header information
- Moves you to the Lines tab to add line items
- Transaction is not yet complete (still needs line items)

---

**Step 2: Lines Tab - Accounting Detail**

After establishing the transaction context, the Lines tab is where you specify the actual financial impact through debit and credit line items.

**Understanding Line Items:**

Every transaction affects at least two accounts (double-entry). Simple transactions have two line items (one debit, one credit). Complex transactions may have many line items, but debits must always equal credits.

**Examples:**
- Simple: Cash sale = 2 lines (Debit Cash, Credit Sales)
- Complex: Equipment purchase with trade-in = 4 lines (Debit New Equipment, Credit Old Equipment, Credit Accumulated Depreciation, Credit/Debit Cash for difference)

**The Lines Interface:**

**+ Icon** (top left)
- Opens the line item entry form
- Click once for each account you need to affect
- Minimum two clicks per transaction (one debit, one credit)

**Lines Table**
- Displays all line items added so far
- Shows: GL Code, Entity, Description, Debit, Credit
- Often shows running totals: Total Debits, Total Credits, Difference
- Visual feedback helps ensure transaction balances

**Reset Button** (top right)
- Clears ALL line items
- Use with caution (usually prompts for confirmation)
- Better to delete individual wrong lines than reset everything

**Create Button** (top right)
- Validates total debits = total credits
- Won't allow saving if unbalanced
- Creates the transaction (usually in Draft status)
- Transaction becomes visible in the listing

**Adding Each Line Item:**

**Required Fields:**

**Branch***
- Can be same as header branch or different
- Allows transactions to affect multiple branches
- Example: Corporate office pays rent that should be split between two retail branches

**Sub Ledger***
- THE critical field - selects the account from your Chart of Accounts
- Determines where this affects your financial statements
- Examples: "1010 - Cash at Bank," "4000 - Sales Revenue," "5010 - Rent Expense"

*Tip:* Take time to select the correct account. Misclassification distorts all financial reports.

**Cashbook***
- Required if the line affects cash/bank accounts
- Identifies WHICH cash account (companies often have multiple)
- Examples: "Main Checking Account," "Petty Cash," "Payroll Account"

*Use Case:* Recording a rent payment, you select "Main Checking Account" to show payment came from that specific bank account.

**Entity***
- Identifies the related party
- Select from: Customers, Suppliers, Employees, or "Internal"
- Creates sub-ledger entries for customer/supplier tracking

*Example:* Recording a sale, select the customer from the list. This updates both the general ledger (Accounts Receivable) and the customer's sub-ledger (Customer ABC balance).

**Amount Debit**
- Enter amount here if this account is being debited
- Leave blank if this is a credit line
- Never enter amounts in both Debit and Credit for the same line

*When to Debit:*
- Increasing Assets (receiving cash, making a credit sale, buying equipment)
- Increasing Expenses (incurring rent, paying salaries)
- Decreasing Liabilities (paying off a loan)
- Decreasing Revenue (sales returns)

**Amount Credit**
- Enter amount here if this account is being credited
- Leave blank if this is a debit line
- Never enter amounts in both Debit and Credit for the same line

*When to Credit:*
- Decreasing Assets (paying out cash, receiving customer payment)
- Decreasing Expenses (corrections or reversals)
- Increasing Liabilities (taking a loan, receiving goods on credit)
- Increasing Revenue (making sales, earning fees)

**Description**
- Line-specific explanation
- Different from overall transaction description
- Explains why THIS SPECIFIC ACCOUNT is affected

*Example Transaction:* Purchase of supplies and equipment for $5,000

- Header Description: "Purchase from Office Depot - Invoice #INV-9876"
- Line 1 Description: "Office supplies - Paper, pens, folders"
- Line 2 Description: "Computer equipment - Monitor and keyboard"
- Line 3 Description: "Payment via company credit card #1234"

#### Line Item Categorization: Add Analytical Dimensions

Add analytical dimensions to each transaction line, including Segment, Project, and Profit Center, for multi-dimensional reporting.

**Why Categorization Matters:**

Basic accounting tells you "We spent $50,000 on salaries." But categories answer strategic questions:
- Which business division spent that? (Segment)
- Which product line was it for? (Dimension)
- Which specific project? (Project)
- Which department or region? (Profit Center)

This transforms simple transactions into powerful business intelligence.

**Category Fields:**

**Segment** - Business Divisions
- Represents major parts of your business
- Examples:
  - By business type: Retail Division, Wholesale Division, Online Sales
  - By geography: North America, Europe, Asia
  - By brand: Brand A, Brand B, Brand C

*Use Case:* A multi-brand retailer tags every transaction with the brand (Nike Store, Adidas Store). At month-end, they generate Profit & Loss by Segment to see which brand is most profitable.

**Dimension** - Custom Classifications
- Flexible category for whatever matters to your business
- Examples:
  - Product lines: Electronics, Clothing, Home Goods
  - Service types: Installation, Maintenance, Consulting
  - Sales channels: Direct, Distributor, Online, Retail

*Use Case:* A software company tags transactions by product (Product A, Product B, Product C). Reports show revenue and costs by product, revealing which products have the best margins.

**Project** - Specific Initiatives
- Time-bound initiatives with defined scope
- Examples:
  - Construction: Building A Renovation, New Warehouse
  - IT: ERP Implementation, Website Redesign
  - Consulting: Client A Engagement, Client B Strategy

*Use Case:* A consulting firm tags all revenue and expenses by client project. At project end, they run a Project Profitability report showing whether the engagement was profitable.

**Profit Center** - Organizational Units
- Parts of the organization evaluated on financial performance
- Examples:
  - Geographic: North Region, South Region, East Region
  - Departments: Department A, B, C
  - Store locations: Store #101, Store #102

*Use Case:* A retail chain assigns every transaction to a store profit center. Each store manager can see their store's complete P&L and is held accountable for results.

**How to Add Categories:**

1. After entering main line item details (Branch, Sub Ledger, Entity, Amount)
2. Click the **Categories tab** (within the line item form)
3. Select values for relevant categories (don't need to fill all—only what's meaningful)
4. Click **Add** button (usually top left)
5. Category tags are now associated with this line item
6. Repeat for other line items (each can have different categories)

**Practical Example:**

*Transaction:* $8,000 salary payment to a project manager working on Client ABC project in the Eastern Region

*Line 1 (Salary Expense):*
- Sub Ledger: Salaries Expense
- Amount Debit: $8,000
- Categories:
  - Segment: Consulting Division
  - Project: Client ABC Strategy Project
  - Profit Center: Eastern Region
  - Dimension: (blank - not relevant)

*Line 2 (Cash):*
- Sub Ledger: Cash - Payroll Account
- Amount Credit: $8,000
- Categories: (typically blank for cash/bank lines)

**Result:** This $8,000 expense is now tagged as:
- Belonging to Consulting Division (segment analysis)
- Charged to Client ABC project (project profitability)
- Managed by Eastern Region (regional performance)

**Reporting Power:**

With consistent categorization across all transactions, you can generate powerful reports:

- **"Revenue and Expenses by Project"** → See which projects are profitable
- **"Sales by Segment by Product"** → Understand which products sell best in which divisions
- **"Costs by Profit Center"** → Hold regional managers accountable
- **"Compare Project A vs. Project B"** → Identify why similar projects have different costs
- **"Margin by Dimension"** → See which product lines have best profit margins

**Best Practices:**

1. **Define categories at the start:** Decide what segments, projects, profit centers your business needs before entering transactions

2. **Be consistent:** Use the same category for similar transactions. If "Rent" always goes to "Corporate" profit center, always tag it that way

3. **Train your team:** Everyone entering transactions should understand what each category means and when to use it

4. **Not everything needs all categories:** Cash/bank lines typically don't need categories. Income/expense lines usually do.

5. **Review regularly:** Monthly, review transactions to ensure categories are being applied correctly

### 2. Sub-Ledger Management

Sub-ledgers provide the granular detail behind main ledger accounts, such as breaking down Accounts Receivable by individual customers. This is crucial for operational management.

**What Are Sub-Ledgers:**

While your main ledger might show "Accounts Receivable: $150,000," the sub-ledger breaks this down:
- Customer ABC owes $45,000
- Customer XYZ owes $60,000
- Customer DEF owes $30,000
- Customer GHI owes $15,000
- Total: $150,000

The sub-ledger detail must always sum to the main ledger total - this is a critical control.

**Why Sub-Ledgers Are Essential:**

**Operational Management:**
- You can't collect from "Accounts Receivable" - you collect from specific customers
- You need to know which customers owe money, how much, and for how long
- Follow-up requires specific customer details and transaction history

**Relationship Management:**
- Track individual customer payment patterns (who pays on time, who's always late)
- Identify your largest customers by outstanding balance
- Manage credit limits per customer
- Maintain complete transaction history for dispute resolution

**Reconciliation and Control:**
- Sum of all customer sub-ledger balances must equal Accounts Receivable main ledger
- Any discrepancy indicates an error requiring investigation
- This control ensures data integrity

---

#### Detailed Views: See Balances for Individual Customers, Suppliers, or Assets

View all journal lines that have affected a specific sub-ledger account.

**What You See:**

The Sub Ledger module provides two main views for each sub-ledger account:

**Main Tab:**
- Company: Which entity this sub-ledger belongs to
- Name: Descriptive name (customer name, supplier name, asset description)
- GL Code: The main ledger account code this rolls up to
- Description: Additional details and notes
- Status: Active or Inactive
- Created/Updated dates

**Editable Field:** Only the Description can be edited. This allows you to add notes, update contact information, or clarify details without changing the fundamental account structure.

*Use Case:* For customer sub-ledger "ABC Corporation," you might update the Description to add: "Payment terms: Net 30 days. Contact: John Smith, john@abc.com. Credit limit: $50,000."

**Journal Lines Tab:**
Complete transaction history showing all journal entries that affected this sub-ledger.

**Display Columns:**

**Txn Date**
- Chronological list of all transactions
- Shows when each financial event occurred
- Typically sorted newest-first or oldest-first

*Use Case:* Customer claims they made a September payment you're not showing. Sort by Txn Date and scan through September entries.

**Journal No**
- The journal entry number for each transaction
- Clickable link to view the complete journal entry
- Takes you from sub-ledger detail back to full transaction context

*Use Case:* Reviewing a customer's history, you see Journal No JV-2025-0812 for a $5,000 transaction. Click it to see the full entry including all line items and details.

**Description**
- What each transaction represents
- Provides context without opening the full entry
- Examples:
  - "Invoice #5432 - Product sale"
  - "Payment received - Check #8765"
  - "Credit memo #CM-123 - Return of defective goods"

*Use Case:* Quickly scanning a supplier's history, descriptions immediately tell you which were purchases vs. payments vs. adjustments.

**Debit**
- Amounts debited to this sub-ledger
- Meaning depends on account type:
  - **Accounts Receivable** (asset): Debit increases balance (customer owes more)
  - **Accounts Payable** (liability): Debit decreases balance (we owe less)

*Customer Receivable Example:*
- Invoice sale: Debit $5,000 (customer now owes $5,000 more)
- Current balance increases

*Supplier Payable Example:*
- Payment made: Debit $3,000 (we now owe $3,000 less)
- Current balance decreases

**Credit**
- Amounts credited to this sub-ledger
- Meaning depends on account type:
  - **Accounts Receivable** (asset): Credit decreases balance (customer owes less)
  - **Accounts Payable** (liability): Credit increases balance (we owe more)

*Customer Receivable Example:*
- Payment received: Credit $5,000 (customer owes $5,000 less)
- Current balance decreases

*Supplier Payable Example:*
- Purchase made: Credit $3,000 (we now owe $3,000 more)
- Current balance increases

**Running Balance** (often displayed)
- Shows cumulative balance after each transaction
- Makes it easy to see how the account balance evolved over time
- Essential for tracking customer/supplier relationships

*Example Display:*
```
Customer ABC Sub-Ledger (Accounts Receivable)

Date        Journal No    Description           Debit    Credit   Balance
Oct 1, 2025 JV-2025-0801 Opening balance                          $5,000
Oct 5, 2025 JV-2025-0812 Invoice #5432         $3,000            $8,000
Oct 12, 2025 JV-2025-0823 Payment received               $5,000  $3,000
Oct 20, 2025 JV-2025-0835 Invoice #5487         $2,000            $5,000
Oct 28, 2025 JV-2025-0847 Payment received               $3,000  $2,000

Current Balance: $2,000 (Customer owes $2,000)
```

#### Transaction History: Complete Audit Trail

**Practical Applications:**

**Customer Collection Management:**

*Process:*
1. Navigate to Sub Ledger module
2. Search for the customer by name
3. Open their sub-ledger account
4. Click Journal Lines tab
5. Review all transactions (invoices and payments)
6. Identify unpaid invoices (debits not matched by credits)
7. Calculate how old each invoice is (days since invoice date)
8. Contact customer with specific invoice references

*Example:* Customer ABC owes $5,000. Journal Lines show:
- Invoice #5432 (Oct 5) - $3,000 - Now 25 days old
- Invoice #5487 (Oct 20) - $2,000 - Now 10 days old
- Last payment (Oct 12) - $5,000 received

*Action:* Call customer: "Hi, we show two outstanding invoices: #5432 for $3,000 (now 25 days past terms) and #5487 for $2,000 (due Nov 5). Can we expect payment this week?"

**Supplier Payment Verification:**

*Scenario:* Supplier XYZ calls claiming they haven't received payment for Invoice #INV-5432

*Process:*
1. Navigate to Sub Ledger module
2. Search for supplier "XYZ"
3. Open their sub-ledger account
4. Click Journal Lines tab
5. Search or scan for "INV-5432"
6. Find the payment entry showing Journal No JV-2025-0823, dated October 15
7. Click the Journal No to see full details
8. See payment details: Check #4523, $8,000, dated Oct 15
9. Verify check cleared the bank

*Response to Supplier:* "Our records show we paid Invoice #INV-5432 on October 15th with Check #4523 for $8,000. The check cleared our bank on October 17th. Let me email you a copy of the cancelled check."

**Month-End Sub-Ledger Reconciliation:**

*Process:*
1. Extract the Accounts Receivable balance from the main ledger (e.g., $150,000)
2. Navigate to Sub Ledger module
3. Export all customer sub-ledger balances
4. Sum all customer balances in Excel
5. Compare: Total customer balances must equal $150,000

*If They Match:*
- Sub-ledger is reconciled to general ledger ✓
- Customer balances are reliable
- Ready to prepare aged receivables report

*If They Don't Match:*
- Review recent journal entries for posting errors
- Check for manual adjustments to GL without updating sub-ledgers
- Verify no customers were excluded from the export
- Investigate and correct the discrepancy before month-end close

**Customer Statement Generation:**

*Process:*
1. Open customer's sub-ledger
2. View Journal Lines tab
3. Export transaction history for the period
4. Generate customer statement showing:
   - Beginning balance
   - All invoices (debits)
   - All payments (credits)
   - Ending balance

*Use Case:* Customer disputes their balance. You send them a detailed statement showing every transaction from your sub-ledger. They can compare it to their records to identify any discrepancies.

### 3. Ledger Management

This is the master registry of your Chart of Accounts, where you can view and manage all accounts.

**What Is Ledger Management:**

Ledger Management is about maintaining your Chart of Accounts - the complete, organized list of every account your business uses to categorize financial transactions. It's the foundation of your accounting structure.

**Why It Matters:**

Your Chart of Accounts determines:
- How transactions are categorized (which account for each transaction)
- How financial statements are organized (which accounts appear where)
- What analytical capabilities you have (level of detail available)
- How reports are structured and presented

A well-designed Chart of Accounts makes accounting intuitive; a poorly designed one causes constant confusion and requires workarounds.

---

#### Ledger Listing: A Complete View of All Accounts

- 6000-6999: Cost of Goods Sold

*Method 2: Hierarchical*
- 1010: Cash - Main Bank
- 1020: Cash - Savings
- 1030: Cash - Petty Cash
- 1100: Accounts Receivable
- 1110: AR - Customer A
- 1120: AR - Customer B

*Benefits:*
- Accounts automatically group in reports
- Easy to remember (all 4000s are revenue)
- Can filter by code ranges
- Creates logical account structure

**Ledger Name**
- Descriptive, user-friendly name
- What appears in dropdown lists during transaction entry
- What appears on financial reports

*Best Practices:*
- Clear and unambiguous ("Office Supplies" not "Misc Supplies")
- Consistent terminology across similar accounts
- Detailed enough to distinguish similar accounts
- Not too long (fits in reports and dropdown lists)

**Company**
- Which legal entity owns this account
- Multi-company environments: some accounts are company-specific
- Some shared accounts might exist across companies

**Status**
- **Active**: Available for use in new transactions; appears in dropdown lists
- **Inactive**: Hidden from dropdown lists; no new transactions allowed; historical transactions remain visible

*When to Inactivate:*
- Discontinued product line (inactivate related revenue/expense accounts)
- Closed bank account (inactivate the cash account)
- Service no longer offered (inactivate related accounts)
- Chart of Accounts reorganization (phase out old accounts)

*Why Not Delete:*
- Deleting breaks historical transaction links
- Historical reports would show errors
- Audit trails would be incomplete
- Inactive status preserves history while preventing future use

**Created Date**
- When the account was added to the Chart of Accounts
- Useful for understanding business evolution

**Updated Date**
- When account details were last modified
- Helps track recent changes to account configuration

**Search and Filter:**

The search bar enables quick account location:
- Search by account name: Type "Cash" to find all cash accounts
- Search by code: Type "1200" to find that specific account
- Search by type: Filter to show only Asset accounts
- Status filter: Show only Active or only Inactive accounts

---

#### Account Editing: Modify Ledger Details

Modify ledger details such as account type and currency.

**What You Can Do:**

When you click on a ledger row, you open the account detail page where you can view and edit certain properties.

**Fields Displayed:**

**Read-Only Fields** (Cannot be changed):
- **Ledger Code**: Locked to prevent breaking report formulas and transaction references
- **Ledger Name**: Locked for consistency in historical reports

*If you need to change these:* Create a new account with correct code/name, make the old one inactive, use the new account going forward.

**Editable Fields:**

**Ledger Type**
- Can be changed, but use extreme caution
- Changing type affects:
  - Which financial statement the account appears on
  - How debits and credits are interpreted
  - Financial ratios and compliance

*Legitimate Reasons to Change:*
- Account created incorrectly during initial setup
- New accounting standard requires reclassification
- Business change necessitates reclassification

*Process Before Changing:*
1. Understand the full impact
2. Document the reason
3. Get approval from accounting supervisor/CFO
4. Make the change
5. Verify financial statements still make sense
6. Document in accounting policy notes

*Example:* An account was initially set up as "Prepaid Insurance" (Asset) but should have been "Insurance Expense" (Expense). Reclassifying it corrects how it appears on financial statements.

**Currency**
- Can be changed if needed
- Affects how transactions in this account are valued
- Consider impact on existing transactions

*Use Cases:*
- Account initially set up in wrong currency
- Foreign subsidiary changes reporting currency
- Currency consolidation requirement

*Considerations:*
- May affect existing transaction values
- Exchange rate implications
- Historical data might need adjustment

**Action Buttons:**

**Save**
- Validates and commits your changes
- System checks that changes don't violate accounting rules
- Confirmation message appears if successful
- Error message explains any problems

**Delete**
- Removes the account entirely
- Rarely allowed and requires special permissions

*Restrictions (most systems):*
- Cannot delete if account has ANY transaction history
- Cannot delete if account has non-zero balance
- Cannot delete if referenced by other accounts or reports

*When Allowed:*
- Account just created and never used
- Account created by mistake during testing
- Duplicate account that was never utilized

*Best Practice:* Make accounts Inactive instead of deleting. This preserves historical data while preventing future use.

## Best Practices

### Standardize Descriptions

Use consistent and clear descriptions for journal entries to make searching and auditing easier.

**Why This Matters:**

Inconsistent descriptions create serious problems:
- **Hard to Search**: One person writes "Office supplies," another writes "Supplies," a third writes "Office stuff" - searching becomes difficult
- **Audit Confusion**: Auditors can't quickly understand transactions
- **Time Wasted**: Month-end review takes longer when descriptions are unclear
- **Error Detection Harder**: Inconsistent patterns make spotting errors more difficult

**The Solution:**

Establish organization-wide description standards and train all users to follow them consistently.

**Description Standards:**

**1. Use Consistent Terminology**

Agree on standard terms and use them everywhere:
- "Office Supplies" (not "Office items," "Stationery," "Office stuff")
- "Customer Payment" (not "Receipt," "Money received," "Cash in")
- "Supplier Payment" (not "Payment out," "Vendor pay," "Disbursement")

**2. Follow a Standard Format**

Choose a format and use it for all similar transactions:

*Format Option A:* `[Transaction Type] - [Party Name] - [Document Reference]`
- "Invoice - ABC Corporation - INV-5432"
- "Payment - XYZ Suppliers - Check #8765"
- "Credit Memo - DEF Company - CM-123"

*Format Option B:* `[Document Reference] - [Party Name] - [Purpose]`
- "INV-5432 - ABC Corporation - Product X sales"
- "PV-8765 - XYZ Suppliers - Office supplies"
- "RCT-9012 - DEF Company - October services"

**3. Always Include Key References**

Every description should contain:
- **Transaction type**: What kind of transaction (sale, purchase, payment, adjustment)
- **Party involved**: Who (customer name, supplier name, or "Internal" for internal entries)
- **Document reference**: Invoice number, check number, PO number, etc.
- **Brief purpose**: What it was for (if not obvious from type)

**Good Description Examples:**

✓ "Invoice #INV-5432 - ABC Corporation - Sale of 50 units Product X"
✓ "Payment - XYZ Suppliers - Check #4523 for Invoice #INV-9876, Office supplies"
✓ "Journal Entry - Monthly depreciation for October 2025"
✓ "Credit Memo #CM-123 - ABC Corporation - Return of defective goods from Invoice #INV-5400"
✓ "Bank Transfer - Payroll - Transfer to payroll account for October salaries"

**Poor Description Examples:**

✗ "Office stuff" - Too vague, no references, no party
✗ "Payment" - Which payment? To whom? For what? Which document?
✗ "ABC" - What about ABC? Sale? Payment? Which transaction?
✗ "Monthly entry" - Which monthly entry? What type?
✗ "Supplies" - Office supplies? Manufacturing supplies? From whom?

**Implementation:**

**Create a Description Guide**
- Document your organization's standard formats
- Provide examples for common transaction types
- Make the guide available to all users
- Include it in training materials

**Train All Users**
- During onboarding, train on description standards
- Show examples of good vs. bad descriptions
- Explain why standardization matters
- Provide quick reference cards

**Review Regularly**
- Monthly, spot-check transaction descriptions
- Provide feedback to users not following standards
- Recognize users who consistently write good descriptions
- Update the guide as needed

**Use Templates**
- For recurring transactions (monthly rent, weekly payroll)
- Create templates with pre-filled standard descriptions
- Users can copy/adapt rather than starting from scratch

**Benefits:**

- Transactions found in seconds using search
- Auditors understand transactions immediately
- Month-end review is faster
- Error patterns become obvious
- New employees understand historical transactions
- Compliance is easier to demonstrate

### Use Reference Fields

Always link journal entries to source documents (e.g., invoice numbers, PO numbers) for better traceability.

**Why This Matters:**

Without proper references, accounting entries are disconnected from supporting documentation:
- **Audit Difficulties**: Can't quickly prove a transaction is legitimate
- **Dispute Problems**: Customer/supplier disputes take forever to resolve
- **Reconciliation Issues**: Can't match accounting entries to bank statements or source documents
- **Compliance Risk**: May not satisfy audit requirements for transaction substantiation

**The Solution:**

Use all available reference fields to create complete trails from accounting entry back to source documents.

**Reference Fields to Use:**

**1. Reference Number Field**
- Use for operational tracking codes
- Examples:
  - Check numbers: "CHK-4523"
  - Wire transfer references: "WT-87654"
  - Purchase order numbers: "PO-2024-0856"
  - Contract numbers: "CNT-2024-125"
  - Batch numbers: "BATCH-2025-10-28"

*Example:* Recording check #4523, enter "CHK-4523" in Reference Number. Anyone can now search for that check number and immediately find the journal entry.

**2. Document Type and Document Number**
- Use for formal document management
- **Document Type**: Category of document ("Supplier Invoice," "Customer Invoice," "Payment Voucher," "Receipt," "Credit Note")
- **Document Number**: Specific ID from your document management system

*Example:* Recording a supplier invoice stored in your DMS:
- Document Type: "Supplier Invoice"
- Document No: "DMS-2025-5432"
- Now the accounting entry links directly to the scanned invoice PDF

**3. Description Field**
- Include all relevant document numbers in the description
- Creates redundant references for maximum traceability

*Example:* "Payment to ABC Suppliers for office supplies per Invoice #INV-9876, our PO #PO-2024-0856, Check #4523"

**Creating Complete Reference Trails:**

**Example: Paying a Supplier**

**Main Tab Fields:**
- Reference Number: "CHK-4523"
- Server Doc Type: "Supplier Invoice"
- Server Doc No: "DMS-2025-5432"
- Description: "Payment to ABC Suppliers for office supplies per Invoice #INV-9876, our PO #PO-2024-0856, Check #4523"

**Result - Multiple Search Paths:**
- Search "CHK-4523" → Find the transaction
- Search "INV-9876" → Find the transaction
- Search "PO-2024-0856" → Find the transaction
- Search "DMS-2025-5432" → Find the transaction
- Search "ABC Suppliers" → Find this and all ABC transactions

**Benefits in Practice:**

**During Audits:**
- *Auditor:* "Show me support for this $5,000 payment."
- *You:* Document No "DMS-2025-5432" → Pull up scanned invoice in 5 seconds
- *Result:* Quick, professional audit response

**During Dispute Resolution:**
- *Supplier:* "We never received payment for Invoice #INV-9876."
- *You:* Search "INV-9876" → Find journal entry showing Check #4523
- *You:* Check bank records → Check cleared October 30
- *Response:* "We paid with Check #4523 on October 28. It cleared our bank October 30. Here's a copy of the cancelled check."

**During Reconciliation:**
- *Bank Statement Shows:* Check #4523 for $5,000
- *You:* Search "CHK-4523" → Find accounting entry immediately
- *Verify:* Amount matches ($5,000 ✓), Payee matches (ABC Suppliers ✓), Entry properly recorded ✓
- *Result:* Quick reconciliation, no mysteries

**During Internal Review:**
- *Manager:* "Why did we spend $5,000 with ABC Suppliers?"
- *You:* Open the journal entry → See Description and Doc No
- *You:* Pull up Invoice #INV-9876 and PO #PO-2024-0856
- *Response:* "It was for office supplies we ordered last month. Here's the PO showing approval and the invoice showing delivery."

**Implementation:**

**Make Fields Mandatory**
- Configure the system to require Reference Number when appropriate
- Require Document Type and No for certain transaction types
- System prevents saving without required references

**Provide Clear Guidance**
- Document what should go in each reference field
- Give examples for common transaction types
- Create quick reference guides

**Train Thoroughly**
- Show users why references matter
- Demonstrate how references are used during audits and disputes
- Practice finding transactions using different reference fields

**Audit Completeness**
- Monthly, review a sample of transactions
- Flag those missing expected references
- Provide feedback to users
- Track improvement over time

### Regular Reconciliation

Reconcile sub-ledgers to their general ledger control accounts monthly to ensure accuracy.

**Why This Matters:**

Without regular reconciliation, errors accumulate undetected:
- Small discrepancies grow into large problems
- By the time you notice, hundreds of transactions are involved
- Root cause becomes difficult to identify
- Corrections are complex and time-consuming
- Financial statements may be materially incorrect

**The Solution:**

Perform monthly reconciliations to catch errors early when they're easy to investigate and correct.

**Critical Reconciliations:**

**1. Accounts Receivable Sub-Ledger to General Ledger**

**Monthly Process:**
1. Extract total from Accounts Receivable general ledger (e.g., GL 1200 shows $150,000)
2. Export all customer sub-ledger balances from Sub Ledger module
3. Sum all customer balances (Customer A: $45K + Customer B: $60K + Customer C: $30K + Customer D: $15K = $150,000)
4. Compare: Sum must equal GL 1200 balance

**If They Match:**
- ✓ Reconciliation complete
- ✓ Customer balances are reliable
- ✓ Ready to proceed with collections and reporting

**If They Don't Match:**
- Review recent journal entries for posting errors
- Check for manual adjustments to GL 1200 without updating customer sub-ledgers
- Verify export included all customers (no filter accidentally applied)
- Look for timing differences (transactions entered but not yet posted)
- Investigate and document the discrepancy
- Make correcting entries to resolve

**Common Causes:**
- Manual journal entry to GL 1200 bypassing customer sub-ledgers
- Deleted transactions not properly reversed
- System error during posting
- Transaction entered in wrong period

**2. Accounts Payable Sub-Ledger to General Ledger**

**Monthly Process:**
1. Extract total from Accounts Payable general ledger (e.g., GL 2000)
2. Extract all supplier sub-ledger balances
3. Sum all supplier balances
4. Compare: Sum must equal GL 2000 balance

Same investigation process if discrepancies are found.

**3. Bank Reconciliation** (Critical!)

**Monthly Process:**
1. Obtain bank statement for the month
2. Compare bank statement transactions to Cash GL account
3. Identify reconciling items:

**Reconciling Items:**
- **Outstanding Checks**: Recorded in your books but not yet cleared the bank
- **Deposits in Transit**: Recorded in your books but not yet on bank statement
- **Bank Charges**: On bank statement but not yet recorded in your books
- **Interest Earned**: On bank statement but not yet recorded
- **Bank Errors**: Bank made a mistake (rare but happens)
- **Book Errors**: You made a mistake in recording

**Reconciliation Formula:**
```
Bank Statement Balance                     $25,000
+ Deposits in Transit                      $2,000
- Outstanding Checks                       ($3,500)
+/- Bank Errors                            $0
= Adjusted Bank Balance                    $23,500

GL Cash Balance                            $23,200
- Unrecorded Bank Charges                  ($50)
+ Unrecorded Interest                      $350
+/- Book Errors                            $0
= Adjusted Book Balance                    $23,500

Adjusted Bank Balance MUST EQUAL Adjusted Book Balance
```

**If They Match:**
- ✓ Bank reconciliation complete
- ✓ Cash balance is accurate
- ✓ All transactions properly recorded

**If They Don't Match:**
- Review each side of the reconciliation
- Check math (addition/subtraction errors)
- Verify all outstanding checks and deposits in transit are listed
- Look for missing bank charges or interest
- Search for transposed numbers (e.g., $1,234 recorded as $1,324)
- Investigate until you find the discrepancy

**After Reconciliation:**
- Record journal entries for unrecorded bank charges and interest
- These entries bring your GL Cash balance in line with the adjusted bank balance

**Best Practices:**

**Timing:**
- Perform reconciliations monthly (minimum)
- Complete before month-end close
- Don't let reconciliations pile up (unreconciled for 3+ months = serious problem)

**Documentation:**
- Prepare formal reconciliation working papers
- Document all reconciling items with explanations
- Have reconciliations reviewed and approved by supervisor
- Keep documentation for audit purposes (7+ years typically)

**Follow-Up:**
- Investigate ALL discrepancies immediately
- Don't make "plug" adjustments to force balances to match
- Understand root cause of each discrepancy
- Implement controls to prevent recurrence

**Escalation:**
- **Minor differences** (rounding, timing): Document and monitor
- **Significant differences**: Investigate immediately, escalate if needed
- **Unexplained differences**: Escalate to accounting manager/controller
- **Persistent differences**: May indicate system issues or control weaknesses

---

### Segregation of Duties

Assign roles carefully. Users who can create journal entries should not be the same users who can approve them.

**Why This Matters:**

When one person controls an entire transaction process without oversight:
- **Errors Go Undetected**: Mistakes aren't caught because no one else reviews
- **Fraud Risk Increases**: Intentional manipulation becomes possible without detection
- **No Accountability**: Can't determine who made errors when only one person is involved
- **Compliance Failure**: Auditors require segregation of duties; lack of it is a control weakness

**The Solution:**

Separate transaction responsibilities among multiple people so no single person has complete control from start to finish.

**Key Segregations:**

**1. Creation vs. Approval**

**Transaction Creator** (Bookkeeper):
- Can create journal transactions
- Enters all details (header and line items)
- Saves in "Draft" or "Pending Approval" status
- **Cannot** approve or post their own transactions

**Transaction Approver** (Accountant/Supervisor):
- Reviews transactions created by others
- Verifies: accuracy, completeness, proper account selection, supporting documentation
- Approves or rejects with comments
- **Cannot** approve transactions they created themselves

*Why This Works:* Creates a review layer. Two sets of eyes catch errors and detect inappropriate transactions before they become final.

**2. Approval vs. Posting**

**Approver:**
- Reviews transaction accuracy
- Verifies supporting documentation exists
- Confirms proper accounting treatment
- Approves but doesn't post

**Poster** (Senior Accountant/Controller):
- Takes approved transactions and posts to ledger
- Finalizes transactions (makes them permanent and locked)
- Verifies approval before posting
- **Cannot** post unapproved transactions

*Why This Works:* Adds another control layer. Even approved transactions get final review before becoming permanent.

**3. Entry vs. Reconciliation**

**Transaction Enterer:**
- Records day-to-day transactions
- Processes invoices, receipts, payments
- Enters data into the system

**Reconciler** (Different person):
- Performs monthly bank reconciliations
- Reconciles sub-ledgers to general ledger
- Reviews account balances for reasonableness
- **Should NOT be** the same person who enters transactions

*Why This Works:* Independent verification. If the same person enters and reconciles, they could hide their own errors or manipulations.

**4. Access vs. Administration**

**Regular Users:**
- Can create and view transactions
- Limited to specific modules
- Cannot change system settings
- Cannot modify user permissions

**System Administrators:**
- Configure system settings
- Manage user accounts and permissions
- Access all modules
- **Should NOT** process routine transactions (or if they must, it should be logged separately)

*Why This Works:* Prevents administrators from using elevated access to manipulate transactions. Prevents regular users from bypassing controls by changing settings.

**Implementation:**

**Define Roles with Permissions:**

**Bookkeeper Role:**
- ✓ Create transactions (Draft status)
- ✓ View transactions and reports
- ✓ Edit unposted transactions they created
- ✗ Approve transactions
- ✗ Post transactions
- ✗ Delete posted transactions

**Accountant Role:**
- ✓ All Bookkeeper permissions
- ✓ Approve transactions created by others
- ✓ Post approved transactions
- ✗ Approve their own transactions
- ✗ Delete posted transactions

**Controller/Manager Role:**
- ✓ All Accountant permissions
- ✓ Approve and post any transaction
- ✓ Perform period closing
- ✓ Access all reports
- ✗ Change system settings (Admin function)

**Administrator Role:**
- ✓ Configure system settings
- ✓ Manage users and permissions
- ✓ Access all functions
- ✗ Should not process routine transactions

**Workflow Configuration:**

Set up approval workflows in Settings:
- Transactions above $5,000 require supervisor approval
- Transactions above $25,000 require manager approval
- Certain transaction types require dual approval
- System prevents posting until approval requirements met
- Audit logs track: who created, who approved, who posted

**Practical Example:**

*Scenario: $10,000 Equipment Purchase*

**Step 1:** Bookkeeper Sarah creates the transaction
- Enters vendor, amount, GL accounts
- Attaches invoice PDF
- Saves as "Pending Approval"
- Sarah cannot approve or post this herself

**Step 2:** Accountant Mike reviews
- Verifies invoice matches entry (amount, vendor, description)
- Confirms GL accounts are correct (Equipment asset, not Expense)
- Checks supporting documentation is complete
- Approves the transaction
- Mike still cannot post it (requires Controller)

**Step 3:** Controller Jane posts
- Reviews approved transaction one final time
- Confirms approval is from authorized person (Mike)
- Confirms amount is within Mike's approval authority
- Posts to ledger (transaction becomes final)
- Transaction now affects financial statements

**Result:** Three people independently verified this transaction. Fraud or significant errors are much less likely.

**Small Organization Considerations:**

*Challenge:* Small businesses may not have enough staff for complete segregation.

*Compensating Controls:*
- **Owner Review**: Owner reviews and approves all significant transactions
- **Monthly Detailed Review**: Owner or external accountant reviews all transactions monthly
- **Bank Reconciliation**: Owner (not bookkeeper) performs bank reconciliations
- **External Accountant**: Quarterly reviews by external accountant
- **Increased Documentation**: Require more supporting documentation
- **Frequent Management Reviews**: More frequent oversight by management
- **Read-Only Access**: Owner has read-only system access to monitor at any time

**Benefits:**

**Error Detection:**
- Multiple reviewers catch mistakes
- Fresh eyes spot issues the creator missed
- Reduces costly errors in financial statements

**Fraud Prevention:**
- Collusion required (much harder than individual action)
- Psychological deterrent (people know others will review)
- Limits opportunity for manipulation

**Compliance:**
- Meets audit requirements
- Satisfies regulatory requirements
- Demonstrates strong internal controls
- May reduce audit fees

**Quality Assurance:**
- Encourages careful work (knowing others will review)
- Creates accountability
- Builds knowledge across multiple people
- Ensures business continuity (not dependent on one person)

- Categories like **Segment** and **Profit Center** pull from Organisation Applet definitions
- Organizational structure determines reporting hierarchies

**Example:** Your organization has three companies (ABC Corp, XYZ Ltd, DEF Inc) and five branches per company - all defined in Organisation Applet. When creating journal entries, you select from these pre-defined structures.

#### **[Customer Maintenance Applet](/applets/customer-maintenance-applet/)**
**What It Provides:**
- Customer master data (names, codes, contact information)
- Customer account settings
- Credit limits and payment terms
- Customer classifications and categories

**How It's Used in Journal Module:**
- When recording sales or customer payments, you select the customer from the **Entity** dropdown
- Customer selection automatically creates/updates customer sub-ledger entries
- Links journal transactions to customer accounts for receivables tracking
- Customer information flows into transaction descriptions and references

**Example:** Recording a sale to "ABC Corporation" - you select ABC from the customer list (maintained in Customer Maintenance Applet), which automatically updates both the general ledger Accounts Receivable and the ABC Corporation sub-ledger.

#### **[Supplier Maintenance Applet](/applets/supplier-maintenance-applet/)**
**What It Provides:**
- Supplier master data (names, codes, contact information)
- Supplier account settings
- Payment terms and banking details
- Supplier classifications and categories

**How It's Used in Journal Module:**
- When recording purchases or supplier payments, you select the supplier from the **Entity** dropdown
- Supplier selection automatically creates/updates supplier sub-ledger entries
- Links journal transactions to supplier accounts for payables tracking
- Supplier information flows into transaction details

**Example:** Recording a purchase from "XYZ Suppliers" - you select XYZ from the supplier list (maintained in Supplier Maintenance Applet), which automatically updates both the general ledger Accounts Payable and the XYZ Suppliers sub-ledger.

**How It's Used in Journal Module:**
- The **Sub Ledger** dropdown in line items pulls from accounts defined in Chart of Accounts Applet
- You can only post transactions to accounts that exist in the Chart of Accounts
- Account types determine debit/credit behavior
- Account structure determines financial statement presentation

**Example:** When adding a line item to debit "Office Supplies Expense" (GL Code 5200), you're selecting from the Chart of Accounts. If the account doesn't exist there, you can't use it in journal entries.

#### **[Cashbook Applet](/applets/cashbook-applet/)**
**What It Provides:**
- Bank account and cash account definitions
- Cash transaction records
- Bank statement data
- Cash position information

**How It's Used in Journal Module:**
- When a journal line affects cash, you select the specific **Cashbook** (which bank/cash account)
- Cash transactions can be imported from Cashbook Applet into Journal Module
- Creates linkage between cash management and general ledger
- Supports bank reconciliation processes

**Example:** Recording a rent payment, you specify it came from "Main Checking Account" (defined in Cashbook Applet). The journal entry updates both the general ledger Cash account and the specific cashbook record.

### Data Consumers (Export To)

The Journal Module feeds transaction data to:

#### **[Financial Reports Applet](/applets/financial-reports-applet/)**
**What It Receives:**
- All journal transaction data
- Complete ledger balances
- Sub-ledger details
- Category-tagged transactions

**What It Produces:**

**Trial Balance**
- Lists all ledger accounts with their debit and credit balances
- Verifies that total debits equal total credits
- Shows the effect of all journal transactions
- Serves as the foundation for financial statements

**Profit & Loss Statement (Income Statement)**
- Extracts all Revenue and Expense account balances from the ledger
- Calculates net profit or loss for the period
- Shows business performance over time
- Driven entirely by journal transaction data

**Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)**
- Extracts all Asset, Liability, and Equity account balances
- Shows financial position at a specific date
- Reflects cumulative effect of all journal transactions
- Balances according to the accounting equation

**How It Works:**
1. You record journal transactions in the Journal Module
2. Transactions post to ledger accounts
3. Financial Reports Applet reads ledger balances
4. Reports are generated automatically with current data
5. Any journal changes immediately affect reports

**Example:** You record $10,000 in sales revenue through a journal entry. This transaction:
- Updates the Sales Revenue ledger account (+$10,000)
- Immediately appears in the Trial Balance
- Flows into the Profit & Loss Statement as revenue
- Affects the Balance Sheet through increased assets (Cash or Accounts Receivable)

**Category-Based Reporting:**
If you've tagged journal transactions with Segments, Projects, Dimensions, or Profit Centers, the Financial Reports Applet can generate reports by these dimensions:
- Profit & Loss by Segment
