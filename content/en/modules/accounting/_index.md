### Phase 5: Opening balance

#### Purpose

The Opening Balance Process is used to bring forward balances from the previous accounting or inventory records into the current system.
This process ensures the new system reflects accurate stock, receivables, payables, cash, and ledger balances after the company transitions into the new environment.

*Note: Some balances may only be available after the previous period’s transactions are finalized or audited. These can be entered progressively once confirmed.*

#### Overview

Opening balance setup involves transferring existing data for the following areas:

| No. | Area | Purpose | Typical Timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stock Balance | Record item quantities and cost values from previous system | Before go-live |
| 2 | Customer Outstanding | Record unpaid invoices or deposits from customers | After go-live (Disable E-invoice) |
| 3 | Supplier Outstanding | Record unpaid supplier bills or paid deposits | After go-live (Disable E-invoice) |
| 4 | Cashbook Balance | Bring forward bank and cash balances | After bank reconciliation confirmation |
| 5 | General Ledger Balance | Record account balances from balance sheet | After finalized previous months reportings |

#### Step-by-Step Process

##### Stock Balance Upload

*   **Purpose**: To import all item quantities and cost values from the old system into the new system before go-live.
*   **Timing**: Perform this process before go-live, after confirming all stock balances from the previous system.
*   **Preparation**:
    *   Create One time supplier in Supplier Applet
    *   Export item balance report from old system separately for each branch/location
    *   Include: Item Code, Description, Quantity, Unit Cost, Total Value, serial number, and branch.
    *   Ensure item codes are exactly the same between both systems.
    *   For serialized items, include:
        *   Serial Number column.
        *   Number of serial numbers = quantity count.
    *   Prepare the import file in the system’s purchase invoice template format.

| BRANCH_CODE | ENTITY_CODE | TXN_DATE | HDR_REF_NO | DOC_CURRENCY | SETTLEMENT_OR_ITEM_CODE | UOM | QTY | UNIT_PRICE_INCL_TAX | ITEM_SERIAL_NO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|             |             |          |            |              |                         |     |     |                     |                |

*   Put `OPENING BALANCE` for HDR Reference.
*   Put `MYR` for the currency column.
*   Put `ONE TIME SUPPLIER` for the Entity code (Create the `ONE TIME SUPPLIER` in Supplier Applet First).
*   Put the UOM based on your Item list in Bigledger (`PCS` or `UNIT` or Others).

![UOM Screenshot](/images/user-guide/Opening-Balance/3.png)

###### Item Details:

*   Update the following columns copy from old system reports to PINV Template:

### 2. AR Balance (Customer outstanding) Upload

#### Purpose
The AR Balance Upload process is used to bring forward customer outstanding balances from the previous system into the new system.Their purpose is to ensure that any post-go-live customer payments are correctly applied against prior outstanding balances.

#### Preparation
*   Disable e-invoice submission for the relevant companies in the Organization Applet.

![Disable e-invoice Screenshot](/images/user-guide/Opening-Balance/11.png)

*   Create `OPENING BALANCE` item In Doc item maintenance applet (Service type item).
*   Create Opening Cashbook and Opening Settlement method for each company in Cashbook Applet - this will be used for outstanding receipt voucher upload.

*   **Export Customer outstanding from previous system / EMP**
    *   EMP Customer:
    *   Navigate: Reports → Manager Reports → CC-07 Historical Transaction Aging Analysis
    *   Select one branch
    *   Set data date (e.g., 31 May 2025) - closing date (cutoff date for migration)
    *   Export using CSV2

    *   Date = `TXN_DATE`
    *   Outstanding Amount= `AMOUNT_INCL_TAX` - (use `ABS` formula to make it positive if negative amount)

*   Fill up the empty cells with `DEFAULT` data
*   Delete empty columns and rows
*   Then the file is ready for upload, you can download it as CSV and upload to Relevant Applets


## Integration Architecture

### Transaction Flow
```
Source Transactions → Processing Applets → General Ledger → Financial Reporting
```

### Data Dependencies

## Next Steps

After implementing the Accounting Module:

1. **Complete Core Module setup** as prerequisite
2. **Configure transaction processing applets** in phases
3. **Set up approval workflows** for each transaction type
4. **Train accounting teams** on new processes
5. **Establish monitoring and reporting** procedures
6. **Optimize performance** based on usage patterns
7. **Implement advanced features** as business grows
