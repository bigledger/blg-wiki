#### Report Best Practices

**For Regular Monitoring:**
- **Daily**: Quick scan of high-value or high-risk items
- **Weekly**: Review items approaching budget limits (>80% utilized)
- **Monthly**: Full budget variance analysis with explanations
- **Quarterly**: Strategic review with senior management
- **Annually**: Comprehensive year-end analysis to inform next budget cycle

**Variance Analysis Framework:**

When reviewing budget reports, use this framework to investigate variances:

| Variance Range | Action Required | Example |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Within ±5% | Normal variance, no action | Budgeted RM 100k, spent RM 98k |
| ±5% to ±15% | Review and document explanation | Budgeted RM 100k, spent RM 112k |
| ±15% to ±25% | Management review and corrective action | Budgeted RM 100k, spent RM 122k |
| > ±25% | Immediate escalation and intervention | Budgeted RM 100k, spent RM 140k |

**Creating Effective Budget Narratives:**

Good budget reports include written commentary, not just numbers:

```
Example Variance Narrative:

Budget Item: IT Software Licenses
Budgeted: RM 80,000
Actual: RM 105,000
Variance: RM 25,000 unfavorable (31% over)

Explanation: Mid-year addition of 50 new users required expanding enterprise license count. Additionally, vendor eliminated volume discount tier, increasing per-seat cost 12%. These factors were not anticipated in original budget.

Corrective Action: Negotiating multi-year contract to restore volume pricing. Implementing software asset management tool to optimize license utilization. Requesting budget adjustment of RM 30,000 for remainder of fiscal year.
```

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Executive Summary Best Practice**: Start budget review meetings with a one-page executive summary highlighting top 5 favorable variances (wins to celebrate) and top 5 unfavorable variances (issues requiring attention).

### 8. Budget Utilization and Validation

![Budget Validation](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-09.png)

#### The Power of Real-Time Budget Control

The most valuable feature of the Budgetary Module isn't budget creation or reporting—it's **automated enforcement**. Real-time budget validation prevents overspending before it happens, not after month-end when it's too late.

**Traditional Budget Control** (Spreadsheet-Based):
1. Department creates purchase order for RM 50,000
2. Purchase order approved and sent to vendor
3. Goods delivered and invoice received
4. End of month: Finance discovers the department only had RM 30,000 budget remaining
5. **Result**: RM 20,000 overspend, budget already blown, uncomfortable conversations

**BigLedger Budget Control** (Real-Time Validation):
1. Department creates purchase order for RM 50,000
2. System checks: Budget register has RM 30,000 remaining
3. **Validation warning appears immediately**: "Budget exceeded - Available: RM 30,000, Requested: RM 50,000"
4. Purchase order line highlighted in red
5. Document cannot be finalized until resolved
6. **Result**: Overspending prevented, department requests budget adjustment or reduces order size

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Business Impact**: Real-time validation shifts budget control from reactive (explaining overages) to proactive (preventing overages). This transforms finance from the "department of no" to the "department of early warning."
{{< /callout >}}

#### Integration with Transaction Documents

Budget validation seamlessly integrates with all transaction-creating applets across the BigLedger platform:

**Purchase Cycle:**
- **Purchase Requisitions**: Budget checked when department requests purchase
- **Purchase Orders**: Budget validated before order sent to vendor
- **Purchase Invoices**: Budget confirmed before payment processing

**Sales Cycle:**
- **Sales Quotations**: Revenue budget validated for commission calculations
- **Sales Orders**: Budget checked for sales-related expenses (shipping, commissions)
- **Sales Invoices**: Budget confirmed for any cost allocations

**Internal Operations:**
- **Journal Entries**: Budget validated for cost allocations and transfers
- **Expense Claims**: Employee expenses checked against departmental budgets
- **Asset Purchases**: Capital budget validated for major acquisitions

#### The Validation Process Step-by-Step

When creating any transaction that affects budget registers, follow this process:

**1. Specify Budget Details for Each Line Item**

For every line item in a transaction document, specify:

- **Budget Votebook** - Which department/unit budget to charge
- **Budget Fiscal Year** - Applicable budget year (usually current year)
- **Budget Fiscal Period** - Specific month or quarter
- **Budget Item** - Expense category (must be linked to votebook)
- **Budget Register** - Specific allocation register to charge against

**Example**: Creating a Purchase Order

```
Line Item: Laboratory Microscope - RM 25,000
├── Budget Votebook: Budget 2025 - Faculty of Science
├── Fiscal Year: FY 2025
├── Fiscal Period: October 2025
├── Budget Item: Laboratory Equipment
└── Budget Register: Q4 2025 - Lab Equipment
```

**2. System Performs Real-Time Validation**

As soon as budget details are entered, the system automatically checks:

| Validation Check | What It Verifies | Failure Result |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Votebook Active | Budget votebook status is active | "Inactive votebook cannot be used" |
| Item Linked | Budget item is linked to selected votebook | "Budget item not authorized for this votebook" |
| Period Open | Fiscal period is open for transactions | "Cannot post to closed period" |
| Sufficient Funds | Transaction amount ≤ remaining balance | "Budget exceeded" warning |

**3. Visual Feedback to User**

The system provides immediate visual indicators:

**Budget Sufficient (Green):**
- Line item appears normal
- No warnings displayed
- User can proceed with confidence

**Budget Exceeded (Red):**
- Line item background highlighted in red
- Warning message displayed above line
- Specific details of budget shortage shown
- Document cannot be finalized until resolved

**Sample Warning Message:**

```
⚠️ Budget Exceeded for Laboratory Equipment - FY2025 October 2025

Current Utilization: RM 45,000
Requested Amount: RM 25,000
Total Would Be: RM 70,000
Budget Available: RM 50,000
Over Budget By: RM 20,000

Action Required: Reduce transaction amount, request budget adjustment, or reallocate via virement.
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Prevention, Not Notification**: Unlike passive budget tracking systems that simply report overspending after the fact, BigLedger actively prevents over-budget entries from being finalized. This is budget control with teeth.
{{< /callout >}}

**4. Resolution Options**

When validation fails (budget exceeded), users have clear options:

**Option A: Reduce Transaction Amount**
- Modify the line item to fit within available budget
- Split purchase into multiple periods
- Defer non-essential items

**Option B: Request Budget Adjustment**
- Submit adjustment request to increase budget ceiling
- Requires proper authorization (CFO, Board, etc.)
- Process adjustment document before finalizing transaction

**Option C: Reallocate via Virement**
- Transfer budget from underutilized register
- Requires approval per organization's virement policy
- Complete virement document, then return to transaction

**Option D: Change Budget Register**
- Use different fiscal period with available budget
- Shift timing of expense recognition
- Ensure aligns with actual delivery/service timing

#### The Utilization Process After Approval

Once the document passes validation and is ready to finalize:

**Before Finalization:**
- Document in Draft status
- Budget not yet impacted
- Can be edited or deleted without financial effect
- Budget balances unchanged

**Upon Finalization:**

1. **Budget Register Updated:**
   - Utilized amount increases by transaction value
   - Remaining balance decreases accordingly
   - Latest allocation stays the same (unless adjustment)

2. **Audit Trail Created:**
   - Transaction recorded in Budget Register Transaction Line Report
   - Links established between document and budget register
   - User, date, and time stamped

3. **Real-Time Reporting:**
   - Budget Report immediately reflects new utilization
   - Utilization percentage recalculated
   - Remaining balance visible to all users

4. **Ongoing Control:**
   - Future transactions validated against updated balance
   - Cumulative spending tracked throughout period
   - Early warning when approaching limits

**Example Flow:**

```
Budget Register Before Transaction:
- Latest Allocation: RM 100,000
- Amount Utilized: RM 60,000
- Remaining Balance: RM 40,000

Transaction Finalized: Purchase Invoice for RM 15,000

Budget Register After Transaction:
- Latest Allocation: RM 100,000 (unchanged)
- Amount Utilized: RM 75,000 (increased)
- Remaining Balance: RM 25,000 (decreased)
- Utilization %: 75% (up from 60%)
```

#### Key Timing Principles

Understanding when validation and utilization occur is crucial:

| Stage | Budget Impact | Can Reverse? |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Draft Document** | None - budget untouched | Yes - simply delete or edit |
| **Validation Check** | Temporary hold (some systems) | Yes - exit without finalizing |
| **Finalization** | Immediate utilization recorded | Requires reversal document |
| **Reversal** | Utilization reversed, balance restored | Creates audit trail |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Best Practice**: Encourage departments to check budget availability BEFORE initiating purchases or commitments. The system provides "check budget balance" functions for this purpose. Prevent surprises by planning ahead.

## Configuration

### Initial Setup Workflow

Setting up the Budgetary Module requires systematic progression through multiple stages. Rushing this process creates problems downstream, while careful setup pays dividends throughout the fiscal year.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Time Investment**: Plan for 2-4 weeks for complete setup in a medium-sized organization. This includes stakeholder consultations, approval workflows, and user training. The upfront investment prevents costly mid-year corrections.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Step 1: Organization Structure Definition

Before creating any budgets, establish your organizational hierarchy.

**1. Define Organizational Hierarchy**
- Map out your complete organization chart
- Identify all budget-responsible units (departments, faculties, divisions)
- Determine reporting relationships
- Document decision-making authority at each level

**2. Set Up Profit Centers**
- Create Profit Center for each budget-responsible unit
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Assign appropriate reference codes (campus, building, cost center)
- Activate only currently-operating units

**3. Configure Reporting Relationships**
- Link Profit Centers to organizational hierarchy
- Set up consolidated reporting groups (all faculties, all support departments)
- Define budget roll-up structure for executive dashboards

**Documentation Checklist:**
- [ ] Organization chart with all units identified
- [ ] Profit Center naming convention documented
- [ ] Responsible manager assigned to each Profit Center
- [ ] Reporting relationships mapped
- [ ] Consolidation groups defined

#### Step 2: Category Framework Design

Categories determine HOW you analyze and report budget data. Design thoughtfully based on decision-making needs.

**1. Create Category Groups**

Identify the major lenses through which you analyze spending:

| Typical Category Group | Purpose | Example Categories |
|----------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Organizational Units | Who spent the money | Faculty A, Faculty B, Department X |
| Expense Types | What was purchased | Equipment, Services, Supplies |
| Funding Sources | Where money came from | Operating Budget, Grants, Donations |
| Functional Areas | Why purchased | Teaching, Research, Administration |
| Account Types | Financial classification | Capital, Operating, Personnel |

**2. Define Categories Under Each Group**

For each Category Group, create specific categories:

- Use clear, unambiguous names
- Avoid overlapping categories (is it "IT Equipment" or "Computer Hardware"?)
- Create enough granularity for meaningful analysis
- Don't over-categorize (every category you create must be maintained)

**3. Set Up Mandatory Category Fields**

Navigate to **Settings → Field Settings → Budget Item Settings** to:
- Configure which Category Groups are mandatory
- Define validation rules
- Set up defaults to reduce data entry

**Design Principles:**
- **Mandatory**: Categories essential for compliance or reporting (e.g., funding source for grant compliance)
- **Optional**: Categories helpful for analysis but not required (e.g., strategic initiative tagging)
- **Default Values**: Pre-populate categories where 80%+ of items use the same value

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Start Simple, Expand Later**: Begin with 3-4 essential Category Groups. You can always add more later, but removing unused categories after data entry is problematic.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Step 3: Budget Items Creation

Budget Items are the standard spending categories used across your organization.

**1. Create Standard Budget Items**

Develop your organization's standard budget item catalog:

**For Educational Institutions:**
- Personnel Costs (Faculty Salaries, Staff Salaries, Benefits)
- Operating Expenses (Office Supplies, Utilities, Maintenance)
- Instructional Costs (Laboratory Supplies, Course Materials, Equipment)
- Student Services (Scholarships, Financial Aid, Student Activities)
- Facilities (Building Maintenance, Grounds Keeping, Security)
- IT & Technology (Software Licenses, Hardware, Network Services)

**For Businesses:**
- Payroll & Benefits
- Marketing & Advertising
- Professional Services
- Office Operations
- IT & Technology
- Facilities & Equipment
- Travel & Entertainment
- R&D Expenses

**2. Assign Multi-Level Categories**

For each Budget Item, link appropriate categories across all levels:

```
Example: Laboratory Equipment Purchase
├── Category Group 1: Organizational Unit → Faculty of Science
├── Category Group 2: Expense Type → Capital Equipment
├── Category Group 3: Functional Area → Research & Development
└── Category Group 4: Funding Source → Grant-Funded
```

**3. Link Items to Category Groups**

Ensure every Budget Item is properly classified:
- Complete all mandatory category assignments
- Validate category logic (combinations make sense)
- Review for consistency across similar items

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Consistent naming convention applied
- [ ] All mandatory categories assigned
- [ ] No duplicate or overlapping items
- [ ] Clear descriptions provided
- [ ] Item codes follow organizational standard

#### Step 4: Votebook Setup and Budget Allocation

With foundation in place, create actual budgets for each Profit Center.

**1. Create Votebooks for Each Profit Center**

- One votebook per Profit Center per fiscal year (e.g., "Budget 2025 - Faculty of Science")
- Use consistent naming pattern across all votebooks
- Link to correct Profit Center
- Add contextual description (scope, exclusions, special notes)

**2. Link Budget Items to Votebooks**

For each votebook:
- Identify which Budget Items this unit is authorized to spend on
- Link all applicable items via Items Tab
- Review for completeness (missing items create problems later)
- Ensure category classifications are appropriate for this unit

**3. Generate Fiscal Year Periods**

- Open each votebook's Fiscal Year Tab
- Click "Generate Fiscal Year"
- Verify all periods created correctly (typically 12 months)
- Confirm Budget Registers generated for all Item-Period combinations

**4. Allocate Initial Budget Amounts**

The moment of truth—putting numbers in the budget:

**Allocation Approaches:**

{{< tabs items="Top-Down,Bottom-Up,Zero-Based,Incremental" >}}

{{< tab >}}
**Top-Down Allocation**

Leadership sets overall budget, distributes to units:

1. Board/Management sets total organizational budget
2. Finance allocates to major divisions or faculties
3. Division heads sub-allocate to departments
4. Department heads distribute to budget items

**Advantages:**
- Ensures overall budget limits respected
- Strategic alignment with organizational priorities
- Faster decision-making
- Clear accountability to targets

**Disadvantages:**
- May not reflect actual operational needs
- Can demotivate units with insufficient budget
- Requires leadership to understand operational details
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
**Bottom-Up Allocation**

Departments request, leadership consolidates and approves:

1. Department heads estimate needs per budget item
2. Requests submitted with business justification
3. Finance consolidates all requests
4. Leadership reviews total vs available funds
5. Negotiation and adjustment process
6. Final budgets communicated back to departments

**Advantages:**
- Reflects actual operational needs
- Department ownership and buy-in
- Realistic planning based on frontline knowledge
- Identifies unfunded needs for strategic discussion

**Disadvantages:**
- Requests typically exceed available funds
- Time-consuming negotiation process
- May lack strategic alignment
- Can be politically challenging
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
**Zero-Based Budgeting**

Justify every dollar from scratch each year:

1. Start with zero budget for each item
2. Departments justify each budget item as if new
3. Prioritize all activities from essential to nice-to-have
4. Fund activities in priority order until budget exhausted

**Advantages:**
- Questions all assumptions
- Eliminates legacy inefficiencies
- Aligns budget to current priorities
- Encourages innovation and efficiency

**Disadvantages:**
- Very time-consuming
- Requires detailed operational knowledge
- Can be demotivating for staff
- Difficult to do comprehensively every year
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
**Incremental Budgeting**

Start with last year, adjust for changes:

1. Use prior year actuals as baseline
2. Adjust for inflation (e.g., +3%)
3. Add new initiatives
4. Subtract discontinued activities
5. Review and approve adjustments

**Advantages:**
- Fast and efficient
- Stable and predictable
- Reduces conflict and negotiation
- Easy to understand and communicate

**Disadvantages:**
- Perpetuates historical inefficiencies
- Doesn't question baseline assumptions
- May miss major shifts in priorities
- Can lead to budget bloat over time
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

**Allocation Best Practices:**

- **Document assumptions**: Inflation rates, growth projections, strategic initiatives
- **Build in contingency**: Hold 5-10% unallocated for mid-year adjustments
- **Align timing with cash flow**: Allocate more to periods with stronger revenue
- **Consider seasonal patterns**: Higher utilities in summer/winter, marketing in Q4
- **Review and iterate**: Budget allocation is a process, not a one-time event

### Field Settings Configuration

Fine-tune how the Budgetary Module operates through Field Settings.

**Navigate to**: Settings → Field Settings → Budget Item Settings

**Configuration Options:**

**Category Group Management:**
- Enable/disable up to 10 Category Groups
- Set display names for each group
- Mark groups as Mandatory or Optional

- Set period naming conventions
- Configure approval workflows

**Validation Rules:**
- Budget overage tolerance (allow 5% overage before hard stop)
- Warning thresholds (alert at 80% utilization)
- Approval limits for virements and adjustments

## Best Practices

### Budget Planning Methodologies

#### 1. Bottom-Up Approach

Departments build budgets based on operational needs, then consolidated centrally.

**Process:**
1. Department managers estimate needs for each budget item
2. Justify requests with business cases and supporting data
3. Submit budget requests to finance team
4. Finance consolidates and identifies total funding gap
5. Management reviews, prioritizes, and adjusts
6. Final budgets communicated back to departments

**When to Use:**
- Organizations with strong departmental autonomy
- When operational expertise resides at department level
- Building buy-in and ownership is priority
- Sufficient time available for consultation process

**Advantages:**
- Reflects realistic operational needs
- High department ownership and commitment
- Identifies strategic investment opportunities
- Frontline knowledge informs planning

**Challenges:**
- Requests typically exceed available funds significantly
- Time-consuming negotiation and adjustment
- May lack strategic coherence across departments
- Political challenges in allocation decisions

#### 2. Top-Down Approach

Leadership sets budget limits, departments plan within constraints.

**Process:**
1. Executive leadership determines total budget envelope
2. Strategic priorities drive initial allocation to divisions
3. Division heads sub-allocate to departments within limits
4. Department heads distribute to budget items
5. Plans reviewed for feasibility and risks
6. Adjustments made to address critical gaps

**When to Use:**
- Strong strategic direction from leadership
- Need to enforce fiscal discipline
- Rapid budget development required
- Clear organizational priorities established

**Advantages:**
- Ensures total budget within organizational capacity
- Strong strategic alignment
- Faster decision-making process
- Clear accountability to targets

**Challenges:**
- May not reflect actual operational needs
- Risk of unrealistic or unachievable budgets
- Lower departmental buy-in
- Can suppress innovation and initiative

#### 3. Hybrid Approach

Combine bottom-up and top-down for balanced planning.

**Process:**
1. Leadership sets overall budget ceiling (top-down)
2. Communicates strategic priorities and must-fund initiatives
3. Departments develop detailed plans within guidelines (bottom-up)
4. Iterative review and negotiation process
5. Strategic items funded top-down
6. Operational items allocated bottom-up
7. Final consolidation and approval

**When to Use:**
- Most organizations, most of the time
- Balance between strategic direction and operational reality needed
- Time available for thoughtful planning process
- Organizational culture supports collaboration

**Advantages:**
- Balances strategic priorities with operational needs
- High-priority strategic initiatives guaranteed funding
- Operational flexibility for departments
- Shared ownership between leadership and departments

**Implementation:**

| Budget Category | Approach | Decision Maker |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Personnel Costs | Top-Down | HR + Finance |
| Strategic Initiatives | Top-Down | Executive Team |
| Major Capital Projects | Top-Down | Board + Executive |
| Operational Expenses | Bottom-Up | Department Heads |
| Departmental Discretionary | Bottom-Up | Department Heads |

### Budget Control and Governance

Establishing clear control mechanisms ensures budget discipline throughout the year.

#### 1. Approval Hierarchy

Define clear authorization limits for budget-impacting transactions.

**Sample Approval Matrix:**

| Transaction Type | Amount Range | Required Approver | Timing SLA |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| **Budget Virement** |  |  |  |
| Within Department | < RM 10,000 | Department Head | Same day |
| Within Department | RM 10,000 - RM 50,000 | Department Head + Finance Manager | 2 business days |
| Cross-Department | Any amount | Finance Director | 1 week |
| **Budget Adjustment In** |  |  |  |
| Grant/Donation Funded | < RM 100,000 | Finance Director | 3 days |
| Grant/Donation Funded | > RM 100,000 | CFO | 1 week |
| Operating Budget Increase | Any amount | CFO + Board | Board meeting cycle |
| **Budget Adjustment Out** |  |  |  |
| Minor Reduction | < RM 10,000 | Finance Manager | 2 days |
| Significant Reduction | RM 10,000 - RM 100,000 | Finance Director | 1 week |
| Major Reduction | > RM 100,000 | CFO + Board | Board meeting cycle |
| **Over-Budget Transactions** |  |  |  |
| Emergency/Critical | < RM 25,000 | Finance Director (post-approval) | Immediate |
| Emergency/Critical | > RM 25,000 | CFO (post-approval) | Within 24 hours |

**Customization Considerations:**
- Adjust amounts based on organizational size
- Consider risk profile (regulated industries may need stricter controls)
- Balance control with operational efficiency
- Document exceptions process for genuine emergencies

#### 2. Monitoring Schedule

Regular review cycles keep budgets on track.

**Daily Monitoring:**
- High-value transactions (> RM 50,000)
- Critical budget items (>90% utilized)
- Emergency over-budget approvals

**Weekly Monitoring:**
- All items >80% utilized with >25% of year remaining
- Departments with consistent over-budget attempts
- Virement and adjustment request queue

**Monthly Monitoring:**
- Complete budget variance analysis
- All departments and all budget items
- Utilization percentage vs time elapsed
- Identify trends and patterns
- Prepare management reports

**Quarterly Monitoring:**
- Strategic budget review with senior management
- Forecast year-end position
- Assess need for major reallocations
- Review budget assumptions and risks
- Plan for Q+1 priorities

**Annual Monitoring:**
- Comprehensive year-end analysis
- Variance investigation and documentation
- Budget performance assessment
- Lessons learned for next cycle
- Budget planning for upcoming fiscal year

**Key Metrics to Track:**

| Metric | Calculation | Warning Threshold |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Burn Rate | Monthly spending / Monthly allocation | >110% of plan |
| Runway | Remaining balance / Average monthly spend | <3 months |
| Variance | Actual vs Budget (%) | ±15% |
| Utilization | YTD spend / Annual budget | >Time elapsed % + 10% |

### Performance Optimization

As your budgetary data grows, optimize performance to maintain system responsiveness.

#### 1. Data Archiving Strategy

Prevent database bloat while maintaining historical access.

**Archiving Rules:**

| Data Age | Action | Retention |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Current fiscal year | Active in primary database | Full detail, immediate access |
| Prior fiscal year | Active in primary database | Full detail, immediate access |
| 2-7 years prior | Archive database | Full detail, slower access acceptable |
| > 7 years | Compressed archive | Summary data + detail on request |

**Archive Process:**
1. At fiscal year-end + 2 years, archive transactions
2. Maintain summary balances in primary system
3. Store detail in archive database
4. Provide archive query tool for historical research
5. Backup archives to compliant long-term storage

**Benefits:**
- Faster primary system performance
- Reduced backup windows
- Lower storage costs (compressed archives)
- Maintained compliance with retention policies

#### 2. Reporting Efficiency

Large budget reports can strain system resources.

**Optimization Techniques:**

**Use Effective Filters:**
- Never run "all data" reports without filters
- Filter by date range (current quarter vs all time)
- Filter by organizational unit (one faculty vs all)
- Filter by budget item (specific category vs entire catalog)

**Schedule Large Reports:**
- Run comprehensive reports during off-peak hours (nights, weekends)
- Schedule recurring reports to run automatically
- Cache frequently-used reports
- Use incremental refresh for dashboards

**Export for Analysis:**
- Export to Excel for complex pivot table analysis
- Use external BI tools for multi-dimensional analysis
- Don't perform complex calculations in the live system
- Leverage data warehouse for historical trending

**Report Performance Tips:**

| Report Type | Best Practice | Avoid |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Executive Dashboard | Last 12 months, summary level | 5+ years of transaction detail |
| Variance Analysis | Current fiscal year, monthly granularity | Daily transaction detail |
| Audit Trail | Specific date range, filtered by user/item | Unfiltered all-time history |
| Trending | Summarized by period, key metrics only | Full transaction replay |
