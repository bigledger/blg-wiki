## Key Concepts

### Budgetary Framework

The BigLedger Budgetary Module operates on a structured framework that answers three fundamental questions:

| Question | Component | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Who** is spending? | Profit Center | Faculty of Science, HR Department |
| **What** are they spending on? | Category | Laboratory Equipment, Training Programs |
| **How** are funds allocated? | Votebook | Budget 2025 - Faculty of Science |

### Budget Hierarchy

```
Organization
├── Profit Centers (Faculties/Departments)
│   └── Votebooks (Annual Budgets)
│       └── Budget Items (Spending Components)
│           └── Categories (Expense Classification)
│               └── Budget Registers (Period Allocations)
```

## Core Features

### 1. Budget Item Management

![Budget Item Management](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-01.png)

#### Purpose & Concept
Budget Items define the specific spending components that make up a votebook's budget allocation. Each budget item represents an element of spending such as:
- Office Supplies
- Marketing & Advertising
- Equipment Maintenance
- Professional Development

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Key Insight**: Think of Budget Items as the building blocks of every budget plan. They ensure uniformity and clarity across the budgeting system before categorization and allocation begin.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Creating Budget Items

1. Navigate to **Budgetary Applet → Items**
2. Click **"+"** Add button
3. Fill in required details:
   - **Item Code*** (e.g., MKTG001)
   - **Item Name*** (e.g., Marketing Expenses)
   - **Description** (optional contextual notes)
4. Click **Save** to create the item

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Best Practice**: Use a consistent naming format such as DEPT-TYPE (e.g., HR-TRAIN for HR Training expenses).
{{< /callout >}}

#### Multi-Level Category Assignment

Budget items can be classified across up to **10 category levels**, providing granular expense tracking:

**Example Multi-Level Classification:**
- Category 0 → Faculty of Science
- Category 1 → Laboratory Equipment
- Category 2 → Maintenance

This flexible categorization enables:
- Structured expense classification across all departments
- Accurate reporting in budget and utilization summaries
- Organizational flexibility (use 3 levels or all 10 as needed)

### 2. Category Group & Category Management

![Category Management](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-02.png)

#### Purpose & Concept
Categories define **what** money is being spent on, while Category Groups provide broader organizational umbrellas.

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Category Group** | Broader grouping level | FAKULTI-SAINS, FAKULTI-EKONOMI |
| **Category** | Specific spending type | Maintenance, Equipment Purchase, Training |

#### Creating Category Groups

1. Navigate to **Budgetary Applet → Category Groups**
2. Click **"+ Add"**
3. Enter:
   - Category Group Code (e.g., FAKULTI-SAINS)
   - Category Group Name
   - Status (Active/Inactive)
4. Click **Create** to save

#### Creating Categories

1. Navigate to **Budgetary Applet → Categories**
2. Click **"+ Add"**
3. Fill in:
   - Category Group
   - Category Code
   - Category Name
   - Description
4. Click **Create**

#### Linking Categories to Items

Categories can be assigned to budget items through the **Category Tab**:
- Select appropriate category from dropdown
- Repeat for additional category levels as required
- Click **Save** to link

### 3. Profit Center Management

![Profit Center Management](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-03.png)

#### Purpose & Concept
Profit Centers define **who** is doing the spending within the organization. Each profit center represents a department, faculty, or division that manages its own budget through associated Votebooks.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Budget Accountability**: Every expenditure is traceable back to a responsible unit, providing clear accountability and departmental spending reports.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Creating a Profit Center

1. Navigate to **Budgetary Applet → Profit Center**
2. Click **"+"** Add button
3. Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Profit Center Code* | Unique identifier (e.g., FAC_A) |
| Profit Center Name* | Name of department/unit |
| Description | Optional brief explanation |
| Ref 1 Code/Name/Description | Additional reference (campus, division) |
| Ref 2 Code/Name/Description | Secondary reference if needed |
| Status | Active / Inactive |

4. Click **Save** to create

**Example Structure:**

| Profit Center Code | Profit Center Name | Description | Status |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| FAC_A | Fakulti A | Faculty of Arts | Active |
| FAC_B | Fakulti B | Faculty of Business | Active |
| FAC_C | Fakulti C | Faculty of Computing | Active |

### 4. Votebook Management

![Votebook Management](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-04.png)

#### Purpose & Concept
The Votebook module manages how funds are distributed across Budget Items and Fiscal Periods. It connects:
- **Profit Centers** (who is doing the spending)
- **Budget Items** (what is being spent on)
- **Fiscal Periods** (when funds are allocated)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Core Concept**: Think of a Votebook as the "spending ledger" of each department or faculty for a specific fiscal year.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Workflow Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Create Votebook] --> B[Link Profit Center]
    B --> C[Attach Budget Items]
    C --> D[Generate Fiscal Year]
    D --> E[Allocate Initial Amounts]
    E --> F[Budget Ready for Use]
```

#### Creating a Votebook

1. Navigate to **Budgetary Applet → Votebook**
2. Click **"+ Add"**
3. Fill in:
   - Votebook Code and Name
   - Linked Profit Center
   - Description / Notes
4. Click **Save**

#### Linking Budget Items

After creating the votebook:
1. Open the **Items Tab**
2. Click **"+ Add Item"**
3. Link budget items that this votebook will manage
4. Each linked item inherits its category classification

#### Generating Fiscal Year

From the votebook's **Fiscal Year Tab**:
1. Click **Generate Fiscal Year**
2. The applet automatically:
   - Creates Budget Registers for each fiscal period (e.g., Jan–Dec)
   - Links each register to the respective budget item

#### Allocating Initial Amounts

![Budget Allocation](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-05.png)

1. Open the **Budget Register** under the fiscal year
2. Enter the **Initial Amount** once
3. The system automatically spreads the value equally across all months/periods

**Example:**
- Enter RM 10,000 → automatically distributed as RM 833.33 per month (12-month fiscal year)

### 5. Budget Virement Management

![Budget Virement](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-06.png)

#### Purpose & Concept
Budget Virement allows users to **transfer** allocated amounts between two budget registers within the same votebook and fiscal year. It's used to reallocate existing funds—not to increase or decrease the total budget.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Important**: Virement redistributes funds without changing the overall budget ceiling. To adjust total allocations, use Budget Adjustment instead.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Process Flow

1. **Fill in Header Details**
   - Select Votebook, Fiscal Year, and Fiscal Period
   - Add Reference # / Tracking ID
   - Enter Remarks / Description

2. **Add Lines**
   - Select Item Code / Name
   - Choose Fiscal Period
   - Select Budget Register **From** and **To**
   - View Amount Allocated
   - Enter Amount To Transfer

3. **Create the Document**
   - Document is saved in **Draft** state
   - Review all lines before finalizing

4. **Finalize**
   - Click **Finalize** to confirm the virement
   - System automatically updates registers:
     - Budget Register From → reduced by transfer amount
     - Budget Register To → increased by transfer amount

### 6. Budget Adjustment Management

![Budget Adjustment](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-07.png)

#### Purpose & Concept
Budget Adjustment allows users to **increase** (Adjust In) or **decrease** (Adjust Out) the total amount allocated to a budget register. Use this when the overall budget ceiling changes.

#### Key Difference: Virement vs Adjustment

| Feature | Virement | Adjustment |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Transfer funds between registers | Increase/decrease total budget |
| **Impact** | No change in total allocation | Changes total allocation |
| **Fields** | Register From → To | Single Register |
| **Adjustment Type** | Always a transfer | Adjust In / Adjust Out |
| **Finalization** | Updates both registers | Updates one register |

#### Process Flow

1. **Fill in Header Details**
   - Select Votebook and Fiscal Year
   - Add Reference # / Tracking ID
   - Enter Remarks / Description

2. **Add Lines**
   - Choose Item Code / Name
   - Select Fiscal Period
   - View Budget Register and Amount Allocated
   - Select **Adjustment Type** (Adjust In / Adjust Out)
   - Enter Amount To Adjust

3. **Create the Document**
   - Document saved as **Draft**
   - Review all entries before finalizing

4. **Finalize**
   - Click **Finalize** to apply adjustments
   - Registers automatically updated:
     - Adjust In → adds to register total
     - Adjust Out → deducts from register total

### 7. Budget Reports

![Budget Reports](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-08.png)

#### Budget Report

The Budget Report provides a **high-level summary** of each Budget Item's financial position:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Item Code / Name | Identifies the specific budget item |
| Initial Amount Allocated | Original amount allocated during budget creation |
| Latest Amount Allocated | Current total after adjustments or virements |
| Amount Reserved | Funds earmarked but not yet utilized |
| Amount Utilized | Actual amount spent or used |
| Utilization % | (Amount Utilized ÷ Latest Amount Allocated) × 100 |
| Remaining Balance | Unutilized funds remaining |

**Available Actions:**
- Generate Utilization Chart
- Search / Filter by votebook, item, or fiscal period
- Export to Excel / PDF

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Reading Utilization**: Positive utilization values indicate spending, while negative values (from reverse adjustments) show fund recovery or reallocation.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Budget Register Transaction Line Report

The Budget Register Txn Line Report provides a **detailed audit trail** of all transactions affecting each budget register:

- Lists every entry (Budget Creation, Virement, Adjustment)
- Shows Budget Votebook, Fiscal Year, Fiscal Period
- Displays Budget Item and Item Code
- Enables complete transaction traceability

**Common Users:**
- Accountants
- Auditors
- Finance Teams

### 8. Budget Utilization and Validation

![Budget Validation](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-09.png)

#### Integration with General Documents

The Budgetary Applet integrates with General Document applets to ensure financial control through automated budget validation and utilization tracking:

- Purchase Orders
- Purchase Invoices
- Sales Orders
- Sales Invoices

#### Validation Process

When processing a transaction with budget-linked items, users must specify:
1. **Budget Votebook** – which budget the expense relates to
2. **Budget Fiscal Year and Period** – applicable financial period
3. **Budget Item** – expense or revenue category
4. **Budget Register** – active register holding the allocation

The system checks:
- Whether sufficient funds are available
- Whether the transaction exceeds the remaining balance

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Budget Exceeded Warning**: If the limit is breached, a validation warning appears and the affected line is highlighted in red. Over-budget entries are prevented unless adjusted through Virement or Adjustment modules.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Utilization Process

Once the document is **finalized**, the budget register:
- Deducts the utilized amount from Remaining Balance
- Reflects updated figures in Budget Utilization Reports
- Ensures real-time tracking of fund consumption

**Key Points:**
- Budget checks occur **before** finalization (Validation)
- Actual consumption occurs **after** finalization (Utilization)
- Over-budget entries are prevented unless adjusted
