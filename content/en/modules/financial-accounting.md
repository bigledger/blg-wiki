# Financial Accounting Module

## Overview

The BigLedger Financial Accounting module provides a comprehensive, standards-compliant accounting system designed for businesses of all sizes. Built with GAAP, IFRS, and local accounting standards in mind, it offers real-time financial insights while maintaining the rigor required for audit compliance.

## Core Concepts

### Double-Entry Accounting

BigLedger implements true double-entry bookkeeping where every transaction affects at least two accounts:

```
Debit Account A = Credit Account B

Example: Sale of $1,000
Debit: Accounts Receivable $1,000
Credit: Sales Revenue $1,000
```
