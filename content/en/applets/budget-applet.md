## Purpose and Overview

The Budget Applet is a comprehensive budgetary management tool that provides structured budget planning, allocation, tracking, and control capabilities. This applet enables organizations to define spending plans, monitor utilization in real-time, and maintain fiscal discipline across departments and faculties.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Budgetary Module Component**: This applet is the core component of the Budgetary Management Module, providing complete budget lifecycle management from planning through reporting.
{{< /callout >}}

### Primary Functions
- **Budget Item Management** - Define spending components and categories
- **Profit Center Allocation** - Departmental budget responsibility
- **Votebook Management** - Annual budget distribution and tracking
- **Budget Transfers (Virement)** - Reallocate funds between registers
- **Budget Adjustments** - Increase or decrease total allocations
- **Utilization Tracking** - Real-time budget consumption monitoring
- **Budget Reporting** - Comprehensive variance and utilization analysis

## Key Concepts

### Budgetary Framework

The Budget Applet operates on a structured framework that answers three fundamental questions:

| Question | Component | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Who** is spending? | Profit Center | Defines departmental responsibility |
| **What** are they spending on? | Category & Budget Item | Classifies expense types |
| **How** are funds allocated? | Votebook & Register | Manages period allocations |

### Budget Hierarchy

```
Organization
├── Profit Centers (Departments/Faculties)
│   └── Votebooks (Annual Budgets)
│       └── Budget Items (Spending Components)
│           └── Categories (Multi-Level Classification)
│               └── Budget Registers (Period Allocations)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Budget Item Management

![Budget Item Listing](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-01.png)

{{< /callout >}}

#### Multi-Level Category Assignment

Budget items support up to **10 category levels** for granular expense tracking:

2. Click **"+ Add"**
3. Enter:
   - Category Group Code (e.g., FAKULTI-SAINS)
   - Category Group Name
   - Status (Active/Inactive)
4. Click **Create**

#### Categories

Categories define specific types of spending under each group.

3. Fill in:
   - Category Group
   - Category Code
   - Category Name

{{< /callout >}}

### 4. Votebook Management

![Votebook Management](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-04.png)

Votebooks manage how funds are distributed across Budget Items and Fiscal Periods.

#### Workflow Overview

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Votebook] --> B[Link Profit Center]
    B --> C[Attach Budget Items]
    C --> D[Generate Fiscal Year]
    D --> E[Allocate Initial Amounts]
```

#### Creating a Votebook

1. Navigate to **Budgetary Applet → Votebook**
2. Click **"+ Add"**
3. Fill in:
   - Votebook Code and Name
   - Linked Profit Center
   - Description / Notes
4. Click **Save**

#### Linking Budget Items

1. Open the votebook
2. Navigate to **Items Tab**
3. Click **"+ Add Item"**
4. Select budget items to manage
5. Items inherit their category classifications

#### Generating Fiscal Year

1. Open votebook → **Fiscal Year Tab**
2. Click **Generate Fiscal Year**
3. System automatically creates:
   - Budget Registers for each fiscal period
   - Links to respective budget items

#### Allocating Initial Amounts

![Budget Allocation](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-05.png)

1. Open **Budget Register** under fiscal year
2. Enter **Initial Amount** once
3. System automatically distributes equally across periods

**Example:**
- Input: RM 12,000
- Distribution: RM 1,000 per month (12-month year)

### 5. Budget Virement (Transfer)

![Budget Virement](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-06.png)

Budget Virement transfers allocated amounts between registers **within the same votebook**.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Key Difference**: Virement redistributes funds without changing the overall budget total. For increasing/decreasing total allocations, use Budget Adjustment instead.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Creating a Virement

**Step 1: Fill Header**
- Select Votebook, Fiscal Year, Fiscal Period
- Add Reference # / Tracking ID
- Enter Remarks / Description

**Step 2: Add Lines**
- Select Item Code / Name
- Choose Fiscal Period
- Select **Budget Register From** and **To**
- View Amount Allocated
- Enter Amount To Transfer

**Step 3: Create Document**
- Document saved in **Draft** state
- Review all lines before finalizing

**Step 4: Finalize**
- Click **Finalize** to confirm
- System updates:
  - Register From → reduced by transfer amount
  - Register To → increased by transfer amount

### 6. Budget Adjustment

![Budget Adjustment](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-07.png)

Budget Adjustment **increases** (Adjust In) or **decreases** (Adjust Out) total allocations.

#### Key Differences: Virement vs Adjustment

| Feature | Virement | Adjustment |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Transfer between registers | Change total budget |
| **Impact** | No change in total | Changes total allocation |
| **Direction** | From → To | In / Out |
| **Registers Affected** | Two (source and target) | One |

#### Creating an Adjustment

**Step 1: Fill Header**
- Select Votebook and Fiscal Year
- Add Reference # / Tracking ID
- Enter Remarks / Description

**Step 2: Add Lines**
- Choose Item Code / Name
- Select Fiscal Period
- View Budget Register and Amount Allocated
- Select **Adjustment Type** (Adjust In / Out)
- Enter Amount To Adjust

**Step 3: Create Document**
- Document saved as **Draft**
- Review all entries

**Step 4: Finalize**
- Click **Finalize** to apply
- Register automatically updated:
  - Adjust In → adds to total
  - Adjust Out → deducts from total

### 7. Budget Reports

![Budget Reports](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-08.png)

#### Budget Report (Summary)

High-level summary of budget performance:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Item Code / Name | Budget item identifier |
| Initial Amount Allocated | Original allocation |
| Latest Amount Allocated | Current total after adjustments |
| Amount Reserved | Earmarked but not utilized |
| Amount Utilized | Actual spending |
| Utilization % | (Utilized ÷ Latest Allocated) × 100 |
| Remaining Balance | Funds available |

**Available Actions:**
- Generate Utilization Chart
- Search / Filter by votebook, item, period
- Export to Excel / PDF

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Reading Utilization**: Positive values indicate spending. Negative values (from reverse adjustments) show fund recovery or reallocation.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Budget Register Transaction Line Report

Detailed audit trail of all budget transactions:

- Lists every entry (Creation, Virement, Adjustment)
- Shows Votebook, Fiscal Year, Fiscal Period
- Displays Budget Item and Item Code
- Enables complete traceability

**Primary Users:**
- Accountants - detailed reconciliation
- Auditors - compliance verification
- Finance Teams - transaction analysis

### 8. Budget Utilization and Validation

![Budget Validation](/images/budgetary-module/budgetary-module-09.png)

#### Integration with General Documents

The Budget Applet integrates with transaction documents for real-time validation:

- **Purchase Orders**
- **Purchase Invoices**
- **Sales Orders**
- **Sales Invoices**

#### Validation Process

When creating a transaction with budget-linked items:

1. Specify budget details:
   - Budget Votebook
   - Budget Fiscal Year and Period
   - Budget Item
   - Budget Register

2. System validates:
   - Sufficient funds available
   - Transaction within remaining balance

3. If exceeded:
   - Validation warning appears
   - Affected line highlighted in red
   - Over-budget entry prevented

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Budget Exceeded Warning**: "Budget exceeded for Sales FY2026 October 2026 (Used 10,000.00, Available 393.33)"
{{< /callout >}}

#### Utilization Process

Upon document **finalization**:
- Budget register deducts utilized amount
- Remaining balance updated
- Reports reflect real-time consumption

**Key Points:**
- Validation occurs **before** finalization
- Utilization occurs **after** finalization
- Over-budget prevented unless adjusted via Virement/Adjustment
