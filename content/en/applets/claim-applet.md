## Key Concepts

### Understanding the Claim Framework

Every claim system must address three fundamental aspects. The Claim Applet provides structured handling:

| Aspect | Component | Practical Example |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Who** is claiming? | Employee/Claimant | Sales Representative, Department Manager |
| **What** is being claimed? | Claim Item & Category | Travel Expenses, Medical Reimbursement |
| **How** is it processed? | Approval Workflow & Entitlements | Multi-level approval, Monthly limits |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Real-World Example**: A sales rep (WHO) submits a claim for client dinner (WHAT) of RM 200. The system checks their monthly entertainment entitlement, routes to manager for approval (HOW), and processes reimbursement upon approval.

### Claim Hierarchy Structure

Think of the claim process as a structured flow:

```
Organization
│
├── Employees (Claimants) ──→ WHO is claiming?
│   │
│   └── Entitlements ──→ WHAT can they claim?
│       │
│       └── Claim Items ──→ SPECIFIC expense types
│           │
│           └── Categories ──→ Classification for reporting
│
└── Approval Workflow ──→ HOW claims are processed
    │
    └── Cut-Off Periods ──→ WHEN claims can be submitted
```

**Flow Through the Hierarchy:**

1. **Organization**: Company-wide policies
2. **Employee**: Individual entitlements
3. **Claim Item**: Specific expense (e.g., Mileage)
4. **Category**: Grouping (e.g., Travel)
5. **Approval**: Routing to approvers
6. **Cut-Off**: Submission deadlines

This structure enables:
- **Precise control** over claims
- **Flexible reporting** by any dimension
- **Clear accountability** for approvals
- **Period-based processing** for finance
