*Figure 5: Mobile Layout of Applet Store - Dark Theme*

The theme of the Applet Store in the mobile layout is a dark theme by default.

# 4.0 Catalog﻿

## 4.1 What is a catalog?﻿
Generally, a catalog in the Applet Store is a collection of applets that are suited for use by a tenant. Every tenant in the Akaun Platform requires different applets for their own operations. Thus, every tenant in the Akaun Platform will be given access to his own unique catalog of applets which are designed for his own use.

Next, the Applet Store consists of both public and private catalogs. The details of these catalogs are described below.

## 4.2 Public Catalog﻿

![Public Catalog Page](/images/applet-store/interface/image-20241110-193055_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 6: Public Catalog Page*

When the users enter the Applet Store after accepting the terms of use of applets, they will be directed to the Public page that shows all the public catalogs with their associated applets. Public catalogs are catalogs that can be accessed by all parties. These catalogs store applets that are commonly used by all parties to perform their operations.

For instance, the screenshot above shows that the MLM Admin applet is an applet under the Public Catalog.

![Applet Information](/images/applet-store/interface/image-20241110-193148_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 7: Applet Information Display*

Additionally, every individual applet in the Applet Store has its own specific icon, name and average user ratings.

Next, every individual applet has its tenant code. For example, staging_tenant. The tenant code identifies the tenant to which the applet belongs. This is because some applets are required by many different tenants. For instance, the Cashbook Applet is needed by many tenants to manage their cash book and settlement methods. However, every tenant needs their version of the Cashbook Applet because they would like to store their private data in the applet. Thus, we have Cashbook Applets with different tenant codes in which each tenant code identifies a specific tenant user. Every tenant user can only access the applet which is associated with his tenant code.

Apart from that, every individual applet has its rank. The rank type includes OWNER, ADMIN and MEMBER. This is because users with different ranks have different roles in managing and using the applets. For instance, users with the ADMIN and OWNER rank have the read and write access in assigning permissions to other users in using an applet whereas the users with MEMBER rank can only have read access to the permissions in an applet.

## 4.3 Private Catalog﻿

![Private Catalog Page](/images/applet-store/catalogs/image-20241110-193437_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 8: Private Catalog Page - Install All*

Next, when users click on the "Private" tab, they will be directed to the page that shows all the private catalogs as shown in the screenshot above. Private Catalogs are catalogs that can only be accessed by users who are given specific permission by the admin.

The admin of the Platform Sysadmin Applet can use this applet to assign permission for users to access their catalog of applets in the Applet Store. As mentioned previously, different clients will gain access to their own catalogs in order to use the relevant applets to carry out their particular operations. Thus, the catalogs and applets shown in this page vary by users.

Apart from that, a search bar is implemented on every catalog page for users to filter and search their desired applets easily. Users can search for their desired applets by typing the name of the applets in the search bar. The search function will be executed automatically once the users start typing words on the bar.

Next, users can click on the "Install All" green button to install all the applets in the "Private" tab page at once. This can save their time from installing the applets individually.

## 4.4 My Applets﻿

![My Applets Tab](/images/applet-store/interface/image-20241110-193742_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 9: My Applets Tab - Installed Applications*

Next, when users click on the "My Applets" tab, they will be directed to a page that shows all the applets they have installed.

# 5.0 Installing Applets﻿

## 5.1 Applet Installation Page﻿

![Applet Installation Page](/images/applet-store/installation/image-20241110-194005_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 10: Applet Installation Page - Overview*

When users click on an applet icon in the catalog page, users will be able to read the details of the applet as shown in the screenshot above. The basic information of the applet that are displayed in this page includes:
- Name of the applet
- Icon of the applet
- Platform location where the applet is stored
- Rank of the users in using the applet
- Tenant Code of the applet
- Compatibility of the applet to the users' device
- Average ratings of the applet
- Number of users who rate the applet

In order to install the particular applet, users can click on the green "Install" button in the applet page to perform the installation.

![Applet Descriptions](/images/applet-store/installation/image-20241110-194026_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 11: Applet Installation Page - Applet Descriptions*

Apart from that, users can view the images and videos that illustrate the features and functionalities of the applet. They can also read the description of the applet from the applet page. By doing that, the users can understand the functions of the applet and the mechanism of using the applet.

Additionally, they are able to know the type of the applet and the ranking of the applet in the Applet Store. For instance, the Stock Transfer applet shown in the screenshot above is labeled as the Business type applet. It is also ranked as the second top grossing applet, meaning the second top applet that generates the highest profit among all the available applets.

![Ratings and Reviews](/images/applet-store/installation/image-20241110-194045_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 12: Applet Installation Page - Ratings and Reviews*

Moreover, users are able to see the rating and reviews of each applet in the installation page of the respective applet. Firstly, the platform will calculate and generate the average user ratings of the applet besides showing the statistics of rating in the form of a horizontal bar chart. It also shows the total number of users who have given the rating.

Next, users can also read the reviews of other users who comment on the applet. Additionally, users can also write their reviews under the reviews section and update their own reviews from time to time.

The applet installation page is still under development.

## 5.2 Open or Uninstall Applets﻿

![Open or Uninstall](/images/applet-store/installation/image-20241110-194139_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 13: Applet Installation Page - Open or Uninstall the Applet*

After that, users can open the applet by clicking on the green "Open" button.

On the other hand, users can choose to uninstall the applet by clicking on the "Uninstall" button in the applet page.

## 5.3 Access Installed Applets﻿

![My Applets Page](/images/applet-store/installation/image-20241110-194200_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 14: My Applets Page - Installed Applets*

As mentioned previously, users can check their installed applets in the "My Applets" page in the Applet Store as shown in the screenshot above. This helps users to find and manage their installed applets easily. Additionally, applets that are successfully installed by the users will show a small green tick label at the bottom right of its layout as shown in the screenshot above.

![Akaun Platform](/images/applet-store/installation/image-20241110-194216_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 15: Akaun Platform - Installed Applets*

Apart from that, users can directly access their installed applets when they log in to the http://akaun.com website as shown in the screenshot above. This helps the users to conveniently access their installed applets without entering the Applet Store.

# 6.0 Applet Permission Settings﻿

Generally, all applets in the Applet Store share some common features. One of the essential features is the permission setting for an applet. This is because a client who uses the applets may want to set specific permissions to regulate the access control of his employees in using the applets.

![Settings Tab](/images/applet-store/permissions/image-20241110-194553_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 16: Settings Tab*

Firstly, users can navigate to the "Settings" tab which is located at the bottom left of every opened applet as shown in the screenshot above to configure their applet settings.

## 6.1 Permission Set﻿

A permission template is a template that consists of one or multiple permission lines. Every permission line refers to a specific defined permission. For example, permission to create internal sales order invoices.

A permission set is a permission template in which the permission lines are configured to targets. The target can be a branch, company, or location, depending on the permission template. By doing that, the targets are permitted to perform certain operations.

Only users with the ADMIN or OWNER rank in the applet can have read and write access in assigning the permissions to the applet users. Users with MEMBER rank have only read access to the permissions settings in the applet.

![Permission Set Page](/images/applet-store/permissions/image-20241110-194612_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 17: Permission Set Page*

### 6.1.1 Create Permission Set﻿

![Create Permission Set](/images/applet-store/permissions/image-20241110-194627_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 18: Permission Set - Create a Permission Set*

Users click on the "+" button to start creating the permission set. After clicking on the button, the Add Permission Set page will appear from the right. Users then fill in the information of the permission set. The information to be filled includes:
- Perm Set Name*: The name of the permission set.
- Perm Set Code*: The code of the permission set. The code value should be unique and is immutable once it is saved.
- Perm Template*: The permission template. A permission template consists of many defined permission lines.
- Status*: Users should select the status "ACTIVE" to use the permission set.

The * symbol indicates information that is compulsory to be filled.

Next, the users have to click on the "Configure Permission Targets" box in order to start linking the permission lines in the selected permission template to the available targets.

![Configure Permission Set Lines](/images/applet-store/permissions/image-20241110-194646_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 19: Permission Set - Configure Permission Set Lines*

A permission template consists of many permission lines. Thus, in the Configure Permission Set Lines page, users can select the permission set lines and assign each of them to a target. The users can proceed by clicking on the permission set line record they want to configure.

![Edit Permission Set Line](/images/applet-store/permissions/image-20241110-194705_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 20: Permission Set - Edit Permission Set Line*

Then, users will be directed to the Edit Permission Set Line page as shown above.

Under this page, the Permission Code, Permission Targets and Default Target information of the selected permission line are already filled and cannot be modified. The value of the Default Target information varies between Company, Location and Branch, depending on the permission template that is selected.

Users can provide some description for the permission set line. Then, users have to click on the "Select Target" box in order to assign the permission set line to a target.

![Add Target](/images/applet-store/permissions/image-20241110-194722_placeholder.svg)

![Successfully Created](/images/applet-store/permissions/image-20241110-194836_placeholder.svg)
*Figure 24: Permission Set - Successfully Created*

The permission set that is successfully created will appear in the Permission Set page as shown in the screenshot above.

In order to assign the same permission set to multiple targets, the users have to create multiple permission sets. Every permissions set consists of the same permission lines but different naming. Then, users assign each permission set to the respective target.

For example:
- Permission_Set_Target_A to Target A.
- Permission_Set_Target_B to Target B.

### 6.1.2 Edit and Delete Permission Set﻿

If the users want to edit or delete a created permission set, users have to click on that permission set record in the Permission Set page. Then, the Edit Permission Set page will appear from the right as shown in the screenshot below, showing the details of the permission set.
