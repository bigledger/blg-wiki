## Key Concepts

### Understanding Claim Cycles

A claim cycle represents a batch of claims processed together, typically over a period like a month. Key elements include:

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Claim Cycle** | Batch of claims for processing | Monthly employee expense claims |
| **Claim Line** | Individual claim item | Single expense receipt |
| **Approval Levels** | Review stages | Manager → Finance → Final Approval |
| **Sampling** | Selection for detailed review | Random 10% of claims |

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Real-World Example**: In a monthly cycle, HR submits employee claims. The system routes them through approvals, samples high-value claims for audit, and generates payment reports.
