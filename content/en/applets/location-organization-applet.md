Each branch can have multiple locations
This is the third icon in the sidebar, "Location." This section lists all the locations, and each branch can have multiple locations. Users can create new locations or edit existing ones here.
The edit tabs are similar to those in https://bigledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AKAUN/pages/3196191408/Branch+-+Organization+Applet#Edit-branch
