*   **Format:** E-invoices must be in the specified UBL 2.1 format (XML or JSON). <mcreference link="https://www.cleartax.com/my/en/e-invoicing-malaysia" index="1">1</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://www.pagero.com/compliance/regulatory-updates/malaysia" index="2">2</mcreference>

## E-Invoicing Models

Businesses can choose the e-invoicing model that best suits their operational needs and transaction volume.

### MyInvois Portal

The MyInvois Portal is a web-based platform provided by the LHDN that allows businesses to manually create and submit e-invoices. <mcreference link="https://www.bdo.my/en-gb/insights/featured-insights/guide-to-e-invoicing-in-malaysia" index="4">4</mcreference> This model is ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with lower transaction volumes. <mcreference link="https://www.bdo.my/en-gb/insights/featured-insights/guide-to-e-invoicing-in-malaysia" index="4">4</mcreference>

### API Integration

For larger businesses with high transaction volumes, direct API integration with the LHDN's MyInvois system is the recommended approach. <mcreference link="https://www.bdo.my/en-gb/insights/featured-insights/guide-to-e-invoicing-in-malaysia" index="4">4</mcreference> This allows for the automated submission and processing of e-invoices directly from a company's existing ERP or accounting system. <mcreference link="https://www.bdo.my/en-gb/insights/featured-insights/guide-to-e-invoicing-in-malaysia" index="4">4</mcreference>

## The E-Invoicing Process

The e-invoicing process involves several key steps, from invoice creation to validation and sharing.

1.  **Issuance:** The supplier creates an e-invoice in the required format and submits it to the LHDN via the MyInvois Portal or API. <mcreference link="https://www.cleartax.com/my/en/e-invoicing-malaysia" index="1">1</mcreference>
2.  **Validation:** The LHDN validates the e-invoice in real-time. Upon successful validation, a Unique Identification Number (UIN) is assigned to the invoice. <mcreference link="https://www.cleartax.com/my/en/e-invoicing-malaysia" index="1">1</mcreference>
3.  **Notification:** Both the supplier and the buyer are notified of the validated e-invoice. <mcreference link="https://www.cleartax.com/my/en/e-invoicing-malaysia" index="1">1</mcreference>
4.  **Sharing:** The supplier shares the validated e-invoice with the buyer, which includes a QR code for verification. <mcreference link="https://www.cleartax.com/my/en/e-invoicing-malaysia" index="1">1</mcreference>
5.  **Rejection or Cancellation:** The buyer has 72 hours to request a rejection of the e-invoice if there are any discrepancies. The supplier can also cancel the e-invoice within this timeframe. <mcreference link="https://www.cleartax.com/my/en/e-invoicing-malaysia" index="1">1</mcreference>
