The Installation Scheduling Workflow handles sales of products that require professional installation, such as built-in appliances, air conditioners, home automation systems, or specialized equipment. This workflow coordinates sales, delivery, and installation teams to ensure seamless customer experience.

## Workflow Overview

```
Sales Order with Installation → Site Survey (if needed) → Schedule Installation →
Delivery + Installation Coordination → Pre-Installation Preparation →
Installation Execution → Testing & Handover → Post-Installation Follow-Up
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Coordination is Key**: Successful installation requires tight coordination between sales, logistics, installation teams, and customer. Poor coordination leads to failed installations and customer dissatisfaction.
{{< /callout >}}

## When to Use This Workflow

Use Installation Scheduling Workflow for products requiring:
- **Built-in appliances**: Ovens, cooktops, dishwashers, washing machines
- **Air conditioning**: Split units, central systems
- **Water heaters**: Storage or instant systems
- **Home automation**: Security systems, smart home devices
- **Kitchen equipment**: Commercial kitchen installations
- **Furniture assembly**: Complex or built-in furniture
- **Specialized equipment**: Gym equipment, medical devices, industrial machinery
- **Audio/Visual systems**: Home theaters, commercial AV installations

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Professional Installation Required**: These workflows assume installations require professional skills. Simple assembly (furniture you can assemble with screwdriver) may not need this level of coordination.

## Detailed Process Steps

### Step 1: Sales Consultation and Assessment

**Responsible**: Sales Staff

#### During Customer Consultation:

1. **Understand Customer Needs**:
   - Product desired
   - Installation location
   - Current setup/infrastructure
   - Timeline and urgency
   - Budget considerations

2. **Assess Installation Requirements**:

   **Ask Key Questions**:
   - What is installation location? (kitchen, bedroom, outdoor, etc.)
   - Is this replacing existing equipment or new installation?
   - Are utilities available? (electrical outlet, water supply, drainage, etc.)
   - What is wall/floor material? (concrete, drywall, tile)
   - Access to installation site? (stairs, elevator, narrow hallways)
   - Any special requirements or challenges?

3. **Determine if Site Survey Needed**:

   **Site Survey Required If**:
   - Complex installation (Level 3-4)
   - Uncertain infrastructure (e.g., electrical capacity, wall strength)
   - Custom or built-in work required
   - Commercial installation
   - High-value installation (reduce risk)

   **Can Skip Survey If**:
   - Simple installation (Level 1-2)
   - Standard setup
   - Customer can provide clear site information
   - Replacing similar equipment

4. **Explain Installation Process to Customer**:
   - Installation timeline (same day or separate visit)
   - Installation duration
   - Site preparation needed
   - Additional costs (if any)
   - What's included / not included
   - Customer responsibilities

5. **Provide Cost Estimate**:
   - Product cost: $_____
   - Standard installation cost: $_____
   - Additional materials (if needed): $_____
   - Site survey fee (if applicable, may be waived if customer proceeds): $_____
   - **Total Estimated Cost**: $_____

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Set Expectations**: Clearly explain what installation includes and what it doesn't. "Installation includes mounting and basic connection. Does NOT include electrical wiring, wall modifications, or removal of old equipment." Prevents disputes later.

   - Structural modifications (wall cutting, reinforcement)
   - Electrical work (new outlet, circuit upgrade)
   - Plumbing work (new connections, drainage)
   - Permits required
   - Estimated time and complexity

3. **Complete Survey Report**:
   - Customer name and address
   - Product to be installed
   - Site measurements and photos
   - Infrastructure assessment
   - Identified challenges

## Managing Installation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Site Not Prepared

**Situation**: Arrive for installation, site not ready (old equipment not removed, area not cleared, etc.)

**Options**:
- If minor: Complete preparation yourself (add time to job)
- If significant: Reschedule installation, explain requirements to customer
- Charge customer for additional preparation work (if policy allows)

### Challenge 2: Inadequate Infrastructure

**Situation**: Electrical outlet wrong voltage, no water supply nearby, wall not strong enough, etc.

**Options**:
- If simple fix: Complete if you have skills and materials
- If requires specialist (electrician, plumber): Explain to customer, provide referral, reschedule installation after work completed
- If survey was done but issue missed: Company may absorb cost as goodwill
- If no survey and customer didn't disclose: Explain additional work needed, provide quote

### Challenge 3: Product Doesn't Fit

**Situation**: Product too large for space, measurements were wrong.

**Options**:
- Check if different model would fit
- Offer exchange if available
- Customer may need to modify space
- Cancel installation, return product for refund
- Take responsibility if company provided wrong information

### Challenge 4: Product Defect Discovered During Installation

**Situation**: Product damaged or defective, discovered during unpacking or testing.

**Options**:
- Document defect with photos
- Don't install defective product
- Contact office immediately
- Options for customer:
  - Replacement product (reschedule installation)
  - Refund
  - Temporary installation of floor model while waiting for replacement

### Challenge 5: Customer Wants Extra Work Not in Scope

**Situation**: "While you're here, can you also install this other item / do this extra work?"

**Response**:
- Politely explain this is outside current job scope
- "I'd be happy to help, but this would be additional work with extra charge"
- Provide quote for additional work
- If customer agrees: Get approval and payment commitment
- If not urgent: Schedule separate visit
- Don't do significant extra work for free (sets bad precedent)

---

## Installation Pricing Models

### Model 1: Free Installation

- Installation included in product price
- Simple installations (Level 1)

- Additional work charged extra

### Model 3: Time-Based Pricing

- Charge per hour of installation time
- Example: "$80/hour, estimated 2-3 hours"
- Fair for variable complexity
- May be unpredictable for customer

### Model 4: Tiered Pricing

- Level 1 (Simple): $50
- Level 2 (Moderate): $150
- Level 3 (Complex): $300+
- Customer knows cost based on complexity
- Clear and structured

### Model 5: Custom Quote

- Survey site first
