2. **Finance Company May Contact You**:
   - To verify product was delivered
   - To get customer contact information
   - To verify warranty or product issues
   - Cooperate and provide requested information

3. **Product Repossession** (rare):
   - Finance company may repossess product

   - Your company typically not involved
   - Depends on finance agreement terms

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Risk Transfer**: The beauty of instalment sales with finance partners is that credit risk transfers to the finance company. You get paid in full; finance company handles customer payment collection.

## Finance Partner Commission Structure

Many finance arrangements involve commissions or fees:

- Or customer pays MDR (added to finance amount)

- Merchant (you) usually absorbs the interest cost
- Finance company deducts this from payment to you
- Plan accordingly when pricing

**Volume Incentives**:
- Higher sales volumes may reduce MDR
- Monthly or quarterly volume targets
- Better rates for large merchants
