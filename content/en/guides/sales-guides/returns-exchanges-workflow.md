The Returns & Exchanges Workflow manages situations where customers need to return products or exchange them for different items after delivery. This workflow protects both customer rights and company interests while maintaining positive customer relationships.

## Workflow Overview

```
Customer Return Request → Validate Return Eligibility → Arrange Collection/Return →
Inspect Returned Items → Process Return (Refund/Exchange/Credit Note) →
Restock or Dispose → Financial Settlement
```

**Balance**: Returns policy balances customer satisfaction with protecting company from abuse. Clear policies and professional handling maintain goodwill even during returns.

## Detailed Process Steps

### Step 1: Customer Initiates Return Request

**Responsible**: Customer Service / Sales Staff

#### Customer Contacts Company:

1. **Receive Return Request**:
   - Phone call, email, WhatsApp, in-person visit
   - Customer explains reason for return

2. **Collect Information**:
   - Customer name
   - **Invoice number** or sales order number
   - **Purchase date**
   - **Product details** (item name, model, serial number)
   - **Reason for return**:
     - Change of mind
     - Defective/not working
     - Damaged
     - Wrong item received
     - Not as described
     - Quality issue
   - **Condition of product**
   - Timeline (when did issue occur?)

3. **Check Purchase Record**:
   - Look up sales order/invoice in system
   - Verify:
     - Customer identity matches
     - Product was purchased from your company
     - Purchase date (within return period?)
     - Payment method
     - Original price
     - Delivery confirmation

4. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Is return request within return period?
   - Is reason valid according to policy?
   - Has product been used or damaged?
   - Are all accessories present?

---

### Step 2: Validate Return Eligibility

**Responsible**: Sales Staff / Customer Service Manager

#### Check Against Return Policy:

1. **Return Period Validation**:
   - Calculate days since delivery
   - Within policy period (7, 14, 30 days)?
   - If exceeded: Explain policy, may escalate to manager for exception

2. **Return Reason Validation**:

   **Change of Mind**:
   - ✅ Within return period?
   - ✅ Product unused and in original packaging?
   - ✅ All accessories and manuals present?
   - Decision: Accept return with possible restocking fee

   **Defective Product**:
   - ❓ What is the defect?
   - ❓ When did it occur? (immediately or after use?)
   - ❓ Warranty applicable?
   - Decision: Accept return, may require inspection, no restocking fee

   **Wrong Item Delivered**:
   - ❓ What was ordered vs what received?
   - ✅ Check delivery order and invoice
   - If company error: Accept return immediately, arrange exchange, apologize
   - If customer error: Explain, may still accept with restocking fee

   **Damaged on Delivery**:
   - ❓ Was damage noted on delivery order?
   - ❓ Are delivery photos available?
   - If damage evident: Accept return, investigate delivery team
   - If no evidence: Assess case by case

   **Quality Issue / Not as Described**:
   - ❓ What specifically is the issue?
   - ❓ Does product match specifications?
   - Decision: May require physical inspection

3. **Check Exclusions**:
   - Is item on non-returnable list?
   - Special sale or clearance item?
   - Custom or personalized item?
   - If excluded: Explain to customer, offer alternatives (warranty service, repair, etc.)

4. **Make Decision**:
   - **Approve return**: Proceed to Step 3
   - **Approve with conditions**: Restocking fee, exchange only, etc.
   - **Decline return**: Explain reason, offer alternatives (repair, warranty service)
   - **Escalate**: Complex cases to manager

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Customer Relations**: When in doubt, favor customer satisfaction. Cost of return is often less than cost of negative reviews and lost future business. Empower staff to make reasonable exceptions.

## Preventing Return Abuse

### Common Return Fraud Patterns:

**"Renting"**:
- Customer buys item, uses it, returns claiming defect or change of mind
- **Prevention**: Thorough inspection, note signs of use, charge restocking fee

**Serial Number Swap**:
- Customer returns different (broken) unit, keeps good one
- **Prevention**: Record and verify serial numbers carefully

**Receipt Fraud**:
- Using fake or altered receipts
- **Prevention**: Verify receipt authenticity, check against system records

**Multiple Returns**:
- Same customer returns many items repeatedly
- **Prevention**: Track return frequency, flag excessive returners

**Wardrobing** (Apparel):
- Wearing item with tags, returning after use
- **Prevention**: Use special tags, inspect carefully

### Protection Measures:

1. **Strict Serial Number Tracking**:
   - Record serial numbers at sale and return
   - Verify match during return
   - Flag discrepancies

2. **Return Frequency Monitoring**:
   - Track returns per customer
   - Flag customers with > 20% return rate
   - May restrict returns for abusers

3. **Photo Documentation**:
   - Photos at delivery
   - Photos at return
   - Compare condition

4. **Receipt Requirements**:
   - Require original receipt or proof of purchase
   - Verify against system
   - Check for alterations

5. **Staff Training**:
   - Train staff to recognize fraud patterns
   - Empower to deny suspicious returns
   - Escalation procedures

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Balance**: Protect against fraud but don't make legitimate returns difficult. Overly restrictive policies damage customer relationships. Find the right balance.
