## 1. Branch Operations Management

### Daily Operations Monitoring
**Question:** "I need to monitor real-time sales performance across all my cashiers during peak hours. How can I set up a dashboard that shows me which cashier is processing the most transactions, average transaction value, and any system errors or voids? I want to spot issues immediately."

**Scenario:** "It's Friday evening, our busiest time. I'm getting customer complaints about long queues, and I suspect one of my new cashiers is struggling. I need to quickly identify which POS station is taking longest per transaction so I can either provide support or reassign staff."

### Staff Productivity Analysis
**Question:** "How do I generate weekly productivity reports showing each staff member's sales volume, transaction count, average sale value, and customer service metrics? I need this for performance reviews and identifying training needs."

**Scenario:** "My regional manager is asking why our branch's average transaction value is 15% lower than other locations. I suspect it's because some staff aren't effectively upselling, but I need data to prove it and identify who needs additional sales training."

### Peak Hour Optimization
**Question:** "What reports can help me identify our actual peak hours versus scheduled staff hours? I want to optimize scheduling to reduce customer wait times and manage labor costs better."

**Scenario:** "I'm consistently over budget on overtime because I'm scheduling based on last year's patterns, but customer traffic seems to have shifted. I need current data to show when we're actually busiest so I can adjust shifts accordingly."

### Multi-Shift Management
**Question:** "How can I track handover procedures between morning, afternoon, and evening shifts? I need to ensure cash counts match, promotions are communicated, and any issues are properly documented."

**Scenario:** "Yesterday we had a RM500 cash shortage that only came to light during the morning count. I need a system where each shift manager confirms the cash float and documents any discrepancies immediately, not the next day."

## 2. Inventory and Stock Management

### Smart Reorder Management
**Question:** "How do I set up automated reorder points that consider seasonality, supplier lead times, and sales velocity? I'm tired of running out of fast-moving items while overordering slow movers."

**Scenario:** "Ramadan is approaching, and I know certain food items will see 300% increased demand, but my current reorder levels are based on normal months. How can I temporarily adjust reorder points for seasonal items without affecting my regular stock?"

### Slow-Moving Inventory Identification
**Question:** "I need a monthly report showing items that haven't moved in 60, 90, and 120 days, along with their carrying cost. What promotional strategies can the system suggest to clear this stock?"

**Scenario:** "I have RM25,000 worth of electronics accessories that are approaching obsolescence. I need to identify exactly which items, their cost basis, and calculate markdown scenarios to clear them before they become complete dead stock."

### Inter-Branch Stock Transfers
**Question:** "How do I efficiently transfer stock between my branch and the main warehouse or other branches? I need real-time visibility of what's available where and automated transfer requests."

**Scenario:** "A customer wants 20 units of a specific smartphone model, but I only have 5 in stock. I can see other branches have stock, but I need to know transfer costs, delivery times, and how to automatically create the transfer request."

### Inventory Accuracy and Shrinkage
**Question:** "What tools help me track shrinkage by category, time period, and potential causes? I need to identify if losses are due to theft, damage, administrative errors, or supplier shortages."

**Scenario:** "My monthly inventory variance is consistently 2.3%, which is above company standard. I need to drill down to see if it's concentrated in specific product categories, staff shifts, or time periods to identify the root cause."

## 3. Financial Performance and Reporting

### Daily P&L Dashboard
**Question:** "I need a real-time daily P&L that shows sales, cost of goods sold, gross margin, and operating expenses. How can I track if I'm meeting my daily profit targets?"

**Scenario:** "It's mid-month and I'm already 8% over budget on utilities and cleaning supplies. I need to see exactly where I'm overspending and how it's impacting my monthly profit forecast so I can make immediate adjustments."

### Branch Performance KPIs
**Question:** "What are the key performance indicators I should monitor daily, weekly, and monthly? I want metrics that help me manage proactively, not just report historically."

**Scenario:** "My regional manager uses metrics I've never seen before - like 'sales per square foot' and 'inventory turnover ratio.' I need to understand how these are calculated in BigLedger and what targets I should aim for."

### Expense Category Analysis
**Question:** "How can I categorize and track all branch expenses against budget? I need to see trends in utilities, maintenance, marketing, and staff costs with variance analysis."

**Scenario:** "My monthly review shows I'm 15% over budget, but I don't know which categories are driving the overrun. I need to quickly identify if it's utilities (new air conditioning), marketing (local promotions), or unexpected maintenance costs."

### Bank Reconciliation Process
**Question:** "What's the proper procedure for daily cash reconciliation and bank deposit matching? I need to ensure every transaction is accounted for and identify discrepancies immediately."

**Scenario:** "Tuesday's bank deposit was RM50 short of the system-recorded cash sales. I need to trace this back through individual POS transactions, cash drawer counts, and identify where the discrepancy occurred."

## 4. Staff Management and Training

### Individual Sales Target Setting
**Question:** "How do I set realistic but challenging sales targets for each staff member based on their experience level, product categories, and historical performance?"

**Scenario:** "I have a mix of experienced and new staff. My top performer consistently exceeds targets by 40%, while others struggle to reach 80%. I need to create fair, personalized targets that motivate everyone appropriately."

### Commission Calculation Transparency
**Question:** "How can staff members view their commission calculations in real-time? I want transparency in how individual sales, team bonuses, and incentive programs affect their pay."

**Scenario:** "Every payday I get questions about commission calculations. Staff want to see exactly which sales counted toward their commission, any deductions for returns, and how team bonuses were distributed."

### Access Control and Security
**Question:** "How do I manage different permission levels for staff? Cashiers need POS access, supervisors need refund authorization, and I need full reporting access."

**Scenario:** "A former employee's access wasn't properly terminated, and they processed a suspicious refund last week. I need to audit all user permissions and ensure proper access controls are in place."

### Training Effectiveness Monitoring
**Question:** "What reports show which staff members need additional training on specific procedures like handling returns, processing payments, or product knowledge?"

**Scenario:** "Customer feedback indicates some staff don't know our return policy properly, leading to inconsistent customer experiences. I need to identify who needs refresher training and track improvement."

## 5. Customer Management and Marketing

### Customer Purchase Pattern Analysis
**Question:** "How can I analyze customer buying patterns to optimize product placement and identify cross-selling opportunities? I want to increase average transaction value."

**Scenario:** "I notice customers buying phones often need screen protectors and cases, but our attachment rate is only 30%. I need data showing what accessories customers typically buy together so I can train staff on effective bundling."

### VIP Customer Management
**Question:** "How do I identify and manage VIP customers who contribute significantly to my branch's revenue? I want to provide special service and targeted promotions."

**Scenario:** "Mrs. Tan spends over RM5,000 monthly at our branch, but I don't have a systematic way to track her preferences or ensure she gets priority service. I need a customer profile system that alerts staff when VIPs arrive."

### Local Promotion Management
**Question:** "How can I create and track local promotions specific to my branch? I need to measure effectiveness and ensure pricing changes are properly implemented."

**Scenario:** "I want to run a weekend promotion on slow-moving inventory, but I need to ensure the promotional prices are active only at my branch and automatically revert to regular prices on Monday."

### Customer Feedback Integration
**Question:** "How do I capture and track customer feedback, complaints, and suggestions? I need to identify trends and respond to issues proactively."

**Scenario:** "I'm getting consistent complaints about long wait times during lunch hours, but I need quantified data showing actual wait times and customer satisfaction scores to justify hiring additional staff."

## 6. Operational Efficiency

### Store Layout Optimization
**Question:** "What sales data can help me optimize store layout and product placement? I want high-margin items in premium locations and ensure smooth customer flow."

**Scenario:** "Our premium electronics section has low foot traffic despite high margins. I need heat map data showing customer movement patterns to determine if the location is the issue or if we need better promotional displays."

### Checkout Efficiency
**Question:** "How can I reduce checkout wait times and improve customer satisfaction? I need data on transaction processing speeds and queue management."

**Scenario:** "Customer surveys show wait time is our biggest complaint. I need to analyze which factors cause delays - payment processing, price checks, system slowdowns, or staff efficiency issues."

### Inventory Accuracy Improvement
**Question:** "What procedures can minimize inventory discrepancies and improve stock accuracy? I need systematic approaches to reduce human error."

**Scenario:** "Our monthly stock takes show consistent variances in fast-moving consumer goods. I suspect it's due to receiving errors or improper recording of sales returns, but I need process improvements to prevent this."

### Branch Benchmarking
**Question:** "How can I compare my branch performance against other similar locations? I want to identify best practices and improvement opportunities."

**Scenario:** "The branch in PJ is consistently outperforming us in profit margin despite similar customer demographics. I need to understand their operational differences and implement their successful strategies."

## 7. Compliance and Security

### Cash Handling Procedures
**Question:** "What are the proper cash handling procedures and how can I monitor compliance? I need to prevent cash discrepancies and ensure security."

**Scenario:** "I suspect some staff aren't following proper cash counting procedures during shift changes. I need audit trails showing who counted what amount and when, with photo documentation of cash drawer contents."

### Audit Trail Requirements
**Question:** "What audit trails does BigLedger maintain for management review? I need to demonstrate proper controls to internal auditors and compliance officers."

**Scenario:** "Internal audit is visiting next month to review cash controls, inventory management, and staff access procedures. I need to prepare comprehensive documentation showing all system controls are properly implemented."

### SST and Tax Compliance
**Question:** "How does the system handle SST calculations and reporting for Malaysian tax requirements? I need to ensure all sales transactions are properly categorized and reported."

**Scenario:** "The tax office is requesting detailed SST reports for the last quarter. I need to generate reports showing SST collected by product category, exempted items, and monthly remittance calculations."

**Question:** "How can I track supplier delivery performance, quality issues, and pricing changes? I need data to negotiate better terms and identify reliable partners."

**Scenario:** "Our main electronics supplier has been delivering 2-3 days late consistently, affecting our stock availability. I need documentation of delivery performance to discuss service level agreements."

### Local Supplier Integration
**Question:** "How do I manage relationships with local suppliers for fresh goods or services? I need efficient ordering and payment processes for smaller vendors."

**Scenario:** "I work with a local bakery for fresh items, but they don't have sophisticated systems. I need a simple way to place orders, confirm deliveries, and process payments while maintaining proper documentation."

### Cost Management and Negotiation
**Question:** "What reports help me identify opportunities for cost savings and support negotiations with suppliers? I need leverage to improve terms."
