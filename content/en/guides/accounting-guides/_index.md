## ⚠️ Common Scenarios / Pitfalls

Watch out for these frequent accounting issues:

| Scenario | What Happens | How to Handle |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Unbalanced journals** | Debit ≠ Credit, entry rejected | Double-check amounts before posting |
| **Wrong period posting** | Transaction appears in wrong month | Verify posting date matches correct period |
| **Duplicate entries** | Inflated balances | Search for existing entries before creating new ones |
| **Missed bank items** | Reconciliation won't balance | Check date range and filter settings |
| **Opening balance errors** | Reports incorrect from day one | Verify trial balance after migration |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Month-End Reminder**: Always complete bank reconciliation before running monthly financial reports. Unreconciled items will cause report discrepancies.
