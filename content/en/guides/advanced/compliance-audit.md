## IFRS/MFRS Compliance Features

Financial reporting compliance requires deep understanding of accounting standards and their practical implementation.

### Revenue Recognition (MFRS 15)

**5-Step Revenue Model Implementation**
```yaml

  - Rights of parties are identifiable
  - Payment terms are identifiable
  - Contract has commercial substance
  - Collection is probable

Contract Modifications:
  - Separate contract treatment
  - Modification of existing contract
  - Combination approach
  - Prospective vs. retrospective

Step 2: Performance Obligations
Identification Criteria:
  - Promised goods/services to customer
  - Distinct within contract context
  - Customer can benefit independently
  - Separately identifiable from other promises

Bundling Assessment:
  - Series of distinct goods/services
  - Same pattern of transfer
  - Single performance obligation
  - Revenue recognition over time
```

**Practical Revenue Recognition Examples**

  Implementation: MYR 150,000 Ã— (35,000/170,000) = MYR 30,882
  Support: MYR 150,000 Ã— (25,000/170,000) = MYR 22,059

Revenue Recognition:
  - Software: At go-live date

### Lease Accounting (MFRS 16)

**Lessee Accounting Implementation**
```yaml

Initial Measurement:
Lease liability: PV of 60 payments @ 6% = MYR 516,074
