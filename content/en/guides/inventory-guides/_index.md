## 🚀 Get Started / Setup

New to inventory in BigLedger? Start with these foundational steps.

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="stock-management" title="📦 Stock Management" subtitle="Set up your items, warehouses, and stock tracking — the foundation for all inventory operations" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

**What you'll set up:**
- Item master data (products, categories, units of measure)
- Warehouse and location definitions
- Stock opening balances
- Reorder levels and minimum stock quantities
- Serial number / batch tracking (if applicable)

**First time?** Complete stock management setup before processing any purchase GRN or sales delivery. Items and warehouses must exist before stock movements can be recorded.

**Typical daily workflow:**
1. Process incoming goods (Purchase GRN updates stock automatically)
2. Pick and pack items for delivery (Sales DO reduces stock)
3. Handle stock transfers between locations
4. Review low-stock alerts and reorder notifications
5. Process stock adjustments for damaged or expired items

## ⚠️ Common Scenarios / Pitfalls

Watch out for these frequent inventory issues:

| Scenario | What Happens | How to Handle |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Negative stock** | Sales/transfers exceed available quantity | Enable negative stock prevention in settings, or adjust before processing |
| **Item not appearing** | Item exists but isn't selectable in transactions | Check item status is Active, company/branch assignment is correct |
| **Missing serial numbers** | Cannot trace individual units | Enable serial tracking in item configuration before first receipt |
| **Stock count discrepancy** | Physical count ≠ system balance | Use Stock Adjustment to reconcile, document reason for variance |
| **Transfer not received** | Outbound transfer shows but inbound missing | Check receiving branch has approved/received the transfer |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Stock Accuracy**: Perform physical stock counts at least quarterly. Discrepancies compound over time and affect purchasing decisions, sales availability, and financial reporting.

## 📊 Reporting Usage

Monitor your inventory health and movement patterns.

**Key Inventory Reports:**
- **Stock Balance Report** — Current stock on hand per item, location, and warehouse
- **Stock Movement Report** — All stock-in and stock-out transactions for a period
- **Stock Aging Report** — Identify slow-moving and obsolete stock
- **Reorder Report** — Items below minimum stock levels
- **Stock Valuation Report** — Total inventory value by costing method (FIFO, weighted average)

**Reporting tips:**
- Check Stock Balance daily for high-turnover items
- Use Stock Aging to identify slow-moving inventory quarterly
- Compare stock valuation against financial reports for accuracy
- Export to Excel for warehouse-level analysis
