With years of extensive experience in the Malaysia market, Wavelet team has been serving one of the largest Southeast Asia's F&B brands with over hundred outlets across the country. With the strong ability to cater to the needs of multi-branch, multi-franchise businesses facing the high volume of daily transactions, Wavelet ERP system has been serving its growing business as a backend for the inventory and accounting data management of its direct branches and franchise businesses for many years.
The consolidated reporting from multiple separate entities is one of the key values provided by Wavelet, allowing the management to make informed business-wide strategic decisions with ease and convenience. The ERP has been integrated to the Point-of-Sale (POS) system for real-time data syncing between both software systems.
