# Malaysian Specific Questions: FAQ for Beginners

*Understanding BigLedger's Malaysian compliance features and local business requirements*

## E-Invoice and MyInvois

**Q: What is MyInvois and when do I need to use it?**

**A:** MyInvois is Malaysia's new mandatory e-invoicing system that will eventually affect ALL Malaysian businesses:

**What MyInvois Actually Means for Your Business**:
- **No more paper invoices**: All invoices must be electronic
- **Direct submission to LHDN**: Tax department gets copy immediately
- **Standardized format**: All invoices must follow government format
- **Real-time validation**: System checks invoices before accepting

**Implementation Timeline** (When YOU need to comply):

**Phase 1: August 2024** (Already started)
- Businesses with annual turnover over RM 100 million

**Phase 2: January 2025** (Coming soon!)
- Businesses with annual turnover over RM 25 million

**Phase 3: July 2025** (Most small businesses)
- ALL remaining businesses (including very small ones)

**What This Means for Small Business Owners**:
- If you make less than RM 25 million per year, you have until July 2025
- If you make less than RM 150,000 per year, you're still required but may get simplified process
- **Important**: Even if you're small, start preparing now!

**Why BigLedger is Perfect for This**:
- We're already fully certified by MDEC (government approved)
- We handle all the technical complexity for you
- You just create invoices normally - we handle the MyInvois submission
- No additional learning required

**Common Small Business Concerns**:

*"I only have 3 customers - do I really need this?"*
→ Yes, if you're a registered business, you'll need to comply

*"I'm not tech-savvy - this sounds too complicated"*
→ BigLedger makes it simple - you won't even know it's happening

*"What happens if I don't comply?"*
→ Penalties start at RM 200 and can go up to RM 20,000

*"I use handwritten invoices now"*
→ You'll need to switch to electronic - BigLedger makes this transition easy

**Q: What is PEPPOL and do I need it?**

**A:** PEPPOL sounds technical, but think of it as the "postal system" for electronic business documents:

**What PEPPOL Actually Is**:
- **International network**: Like email, but for business documents
- **Secure delivery**: Guaranteed delivery of invoices and orders
- **Global standard**: Used by 40+ countries worldwide
- **Business benefits**: Faster payments, fewer errors, better relationships

**Do You Need PEPPOL?**
- **Yes, if you sell to**: Government agencies, large corporations, international customers
- **Maybe, if you sell to**: Medium-sized Malaysian businesses (they may require it)
- **Probably not yet, if you sell to**: Individual consumers, very small businesses

**Why BigLedger's PEPPOL Certification Matters**:
- **Future-proof**: Ready when your customers require it
- **No extra cost**: PEPPOL capability included in BigLedger
- **Automatic setup**: We handle all technical configuration
- **Competitive advantage**: Many of your competitors don't have this yet

**Real-World Examples**:

*Ahmad's Air Conditioning Service*:
- Mostly residential customers: Doesn't need PEPPOL now
- Gets contract with government building: PEPPOL required
- With BigLedger: Just tick a box, everything else automatic

*Siti's Catering Business*:
- Supplies corporate events: Some clients starting to require PEPPOL
- With BigLedger: Can offer electronic invoicing as premium service

**The Bottom Line**: You may not need PEPPOL today, but having it ready gives you more business opportunities.
