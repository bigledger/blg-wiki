# Getting Started with BigLedger: FAQ for Beginners

*A comprehensive guide for small business owners new to ERP systems*

## What is BigLedger and why do I need it?

### Q: I run a small business using Excel spreadsheets and simple bookkeeping. Why should I switch to BigLedger?

**A:** Think of BigLedger as upgrading from a bicycle to a car. While Excel works for simple tracking, BigLedger is a complete Business Operating System that:

- **Eliminates manual errors**: No more copying data between spreadsheets
- **Saves time**: What takes hours in Excel happens instantly
- **Provides real-time insights**: Know your business performance immediately
- **Grows with you**: Handles everything from 1 employee to 1,000+
- **Ensures compliance**: Automatically follows accounting standards and tax laws

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Real example**: Maria runs a bakery with 3 locations. With Excel, she spent 10 hours weekly updating inventory, sales, and expenses across multiple sheets. With BigLedger, this happens automatically when transactions are entered, saving her 10 hours per week.

### Q: What exactly does BigLedger do for my business?

**A:** BigLedger is like having a team of experts managing different parts of your business:

- **Accounting Expert**: Handles all your books, taxes, and financial reports
- **Inventory Manager**: Tracks what you have, what you need, what you sold
- **Sales Assistant**: Manages customers, quotes, orders, and follow-ups
- **HR Coordinator**: Handles employee records, payroll, and scheduling
- **Operations Manager**: Connects everything together for smooth operations

### Q: I've heard of QuickBooks - how is BigLedger different?

**A:** Great question! Here's the key difference:

| Feature | QuickBooks | BigLedger |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Approach** | Accounting software with add-ons | Complete business operating system |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed structure | Modular - add what you need |
| **Growth** | Need to switch as you grow | Grows with you seamlessly |
| **AI Features** | Basic automation | Advanced AI for document processing, predictions |
| **Integration** | Limited, expensive add-ons | Everything connects naturally |
| **Malaysian Compliance** | Limited local support | Built for Malaysian businesses |

**Bottom line**: QuickBooks is like buying individual tools; BigLedger is like getting a complete workshop that expands as you need it.

## Understanding ERP and Business Systems

### Q: What does "ERP" mean and why should I care?

**A:** ERP stands for "Enterprise Resource Planning" - but forget the fancy name! Think of it as:

**Your Business Brain**: Just like your brain coordinates different body parts, ERP coordinates different business functions:
- When you make a sale → automatically updates inventory, accounting, and customer records
- When you receive inventory → automatically updates costs and stock levels
- When you pay employees → automatically updates expenses and tax obligations

**Why you should care**:
- **Stop double-entry**: Enter data once, it updates everywhere
- **Get the full picture**: See how all parts of your business connect
- **Make better decisions**: Have accurate, up-to-date information
- **Avoid costly mistakes**: Reduce human errors that cost money

### Q: Do I need to be an accountant to use this?

**A:** Absolutely not! BigLedger is designed for business owners, not accountants. Here's what we mean:

**What BigLedger handles automatically**:
- Creates proper accounting entries (debits/credits)
- Calculates taxes
- Generates financial reports
- Follows accounting standards

**What you focus on**:
- Running your business
- Entering simple transactions ("I sold this," "I bought that")
- Making business decisions with the insights provided

**Think of it like driving a car**: You don't need to understand the engine to drive safely. You just need to know the basic controls.

## Getting Started: Preparation and Setup

### Q: How long will it take to set up my business in BigLedger?

**A:** This depends on your business complexity, but here are realistic timelines:

**Very Small Business** (1-5 employees, simple operations):
- Basic setup: 1-2 days
- Full implementation: 1-2 weeks
- Team training: 2-3 days

**Small Business** (5-20 employees, multiple processes):
- Basic setup: 3-5 days
- Full implementation: 3-6 weeks
- Team training: 1-2 weeks

**Growing Business** (20+ employees, complex operations):

### Q: What information do I need to prepare before starting?

**A:** Think of this as preparing to move to a new house - you need to gather your important documents:

- [ ] Bank account information
- [ ] Current customer list with contact information
- [ ] Current supplier/vendor list
- [ ] Product/service list with current prices

4. **Start using**: Begin with clean, organized data

### Q: I'm worried about making mistakes that could mess up my business. What safeguards are there?
