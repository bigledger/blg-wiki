**TODO: Add comprehensive best practices content based on successful customer implementations**

## Implementation Best Practices

### Planning Phase
- **Requirements Analysis**: Thoroughly document current processes before implementation
- **Phased Approach**: Implement core modules first, then add specialized features
- **Change Management**: Prepare your team for new processes and workflows
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable goals for implementation success
- **Timeline Realism**: Allow adequate time for training and testing

### Configuration Strategy
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic configurations, add complexity gradually
- **Data Quality**: Ensure clean, accurate master data before going live
- **Permission Structure**: Design role-based permissions from the beginning
- **Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent naming standards across all data
- **Documentation**: Document all configuration decisions and customizations

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
**Implementation Tip**: Most successful BigLedger implementations follow the 20-80 rule: Get 20% of features working perfectly before adding the remaining 80% of advanced functionality.
