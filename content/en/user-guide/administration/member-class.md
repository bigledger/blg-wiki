## Current Basic Functionality

### Creating Member Classes

1. Navigate to **Member Class** from the main module list
2. Click the **"+"** button to create a new member class
3. Complete required information:
   - **Membership Class Code**: System-generated identifier
   - **Membership Class Name**: Descriptive name for the role

### Managing Existing Classes

- **Edit**: Modify member class name and status
- **Delete**: Remove unused member classes
- **List View**: Browse all configured member classifications

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Current Limitation**: This basic implementation needs expansion to cover comprehensive role-based access control, security policies, and integration with BigLedger's complete permission system.
