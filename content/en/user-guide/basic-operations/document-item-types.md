# Document Item Types & Classifications

Understanding BigLedger's document item types is fundamental to effective inventory management, sales processing, and business operations. Each item type serves specific business scenarios and offers unique functionality for managing complex inventory relationships.

## Overview

BigLedger supports five distinct document item types, each designed for specific business scenarios and inventory relationships. These types determine how items behave in transactions, inventory tracking, and financial reporting.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Foundation Concept**: Document items in BigLedger represent business entities that can be sold, purchased, or managed. The item type determines the relationship between the document item (FI-item) and physical inventory items (INV items).

## The Five Document Item Types

### 1. Basic Item (FI-Item)

**Definition**: A basic item maintains a one-to-one relationship with a physical inventory item (INV item), representing the simplest and most common item type in BigLedger.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Direct Mapping**: One FI-item equals one INV item
- **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time stock level updates
- **Simple Processing**: Straightforward sales and purchase transactions
- **Financial Integration**: Direct cost and revenue posting
- **Barcode Support**: Standard barcode scanning and identification

#### Business Use Cases

### 2. Kit Item

**Definition**: A kit combines multiple basic items into a single sellable unit while maintaining inventory tracking for individual components through automated kitting and reverse kitting processes.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Component Structure**: Parent kit with multiple child components
- **Automatic Processing**: System-managed kitting and reverse kitting
- **Dual Inventory Impact**: Components reduce, assembled kit increases
- **Manufacturing Integration**: Production and assembly workflows
- **Quality Control**: Component verification and validation

#### Component Management

**Kitting Process**:
1. Select kit components from inventory
2. System validates component availability
3. Component stock levels decrease
4. Assembled kit stock increases by one unit
5. Cost calculation includes all component costs

**Reverse Kitting Process**:
1. Kit is disassembled back to components
2. Kit stock level decreases
3. Individual component stock levels increase
4. Cost accounting reverses to component values
