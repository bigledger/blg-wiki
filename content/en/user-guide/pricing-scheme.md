**Page ID**: 3313139757
**Last Updated**: 2024-11-12T21:27:30.118Z
Once a user clicks on the pricing scheme module it will land on the pricing scheme listing page. The module is used to create the template for pricing that can be also used in transactional applets such as POS, GRN, etc. In this module you can only create the template/scheme, the price can be added later for each specific item in the "Item Maintenance" module
For example, in the POS applet, users can go to the settings and choose which Pricing Scheme they want to use for a minimum price, maximum price or the retail price as shown in the interface below:
