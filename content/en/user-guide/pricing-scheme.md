# Pricing Schemes & Strategy Management

Master BigLedger's flexible pricing system to create sophisticated pricing strategies that adapt to different customers, markets, and business scenarios while maintaining profitability and competitive positioning.

## Overview

Pricing schemes in BigLedger are powerful templates that define pricing structures for your products and services. These schemes can be applied across multiple business modules including POS, sales orders, quotations, and e-commerce platforms, providing consistent pricing while allowing for customer-specific and scenario-based flexibility.

**Key Concept**: Pricing schemes create the framework, while actual item prices are set in the [Item Maintenance](/user-guide/item-maintenance/) module. This separation allows for flexible pricing strategies across different customer segments and sales channels.
