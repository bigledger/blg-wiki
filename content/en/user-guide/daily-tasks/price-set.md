# Price Set Configuration & Advanced Pricing

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**ðŸš§ Content Under Development**: This page contains basic functionality notes and requires comprehensive documentation. Critical areas needing development:

- **Rule-Based Pricing Logic**: Detailed explanation of pricing rules and conditions
- **Multi-Level Pricing**: Complex pricing hierarchies and inheritance
- **Business Rule Examples**: Real-world scenarios and use cases
- **Integration Workflows**: How price sets work with other pricing components
- **Performance Optimization**: Managing large-scale pricing configurations
{{< /callout >}}

## Overview

Price sets in BigLedger provide advanced pricing configuration capabilities that go beyond basic pricing schemes. They enable complex, rule-based pricing logic that can adapt to various business conditions, customer segments, and operational scenarios.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Foundation Required**: Price sets work in conjunction with [Price Books](/user-guide/price-book/) and [Pricing Schemes](/user-guide/pricing-scheme/). Ensure you understand these concepts before configuring price sets.

## TODO: Comprehensive Documentation Needed

### Priority 1: Core Concepts
- [ ] **Price Set Architecture**: How price sets fit into BigLedger's pricing ecosystem
- [ ] **Rule Logic System**: Understanding AND/OR logic, negation, and complex conditions
- [ ] **Priority Management**: How multiple price sets interact and override each other
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Optimizing price set configurations for large catalogs

### Priority 2: Rule Configuration
- [ ] **Document Header Rules**: Customer, date, and entity-based pricing
- [ ] **Line Item Rules**: Product-specific and category-based pricing logic
- [ ] **Treatment Options**: Discount, markup, fixed price, and percentage adjustments
- [ ] **Validation Systems**: Ensuring pricing rules don't conflict

### Priority 3: Advanced Implementation
- [ ] **Complex Scenarios**: Multi-tier distributor pricing, seasonal adjustments
- [ ] **Integration Examples**: POS, e-commerce, and B2B portal configurations
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and resolution strategies
- [ ] **Best Practices**: Performance optimization and maintenance strategies

## Current Basic Functionality

### Creating Price Sets

**Required Information**:
- **Price Book Name**: Select from existing price books (must be created first)
- **Price Set Code**: System-generated, cannot be modified
- **Price Set Name**: Descriptive identifier
- **Priority Level**: Determines rule application order

### Basic Configuration Tabs

**Details Tab**
- Edit price set name and priority level
- Manage active/inactive status
- Delete unused price sets

**Rules - Document Header**
- Configure customer-level pricing rules
- Set date range validations
- Apply entity-specific pricing

**Rules - Multi Line & Single Line**
- Item-specific pricing conditions
- Category-based rule application
- Regular expression matching for complex criteria

**Treatment Configuration**
- Define pricing adjustments (discounts, markups)
- Set calculation methods and values
- Configure rule application behavior

## Immediate Next Steps

While comprehensive documentation is being developed:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic price sets using single rules
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify pricing calculations in a test environment
3. **Document Decisions**: Keep records of your pricing logic for future reference
4. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any slowdowns with complex rule sets
