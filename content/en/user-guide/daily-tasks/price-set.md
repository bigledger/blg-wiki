## Priority Management and Rule Conflict Resolution

### Understanding Priority Systems

Priority management ensures that when multiple price sets could apply to the same transaction, the system applies the most appropriate pricing in a predictable, business-logical manner.

#### Priority Hierarchy

**Numerical Priority System**:
- **Priority 1**: Highest priority rules (most specific, critical business rules)
- **Priority 2-5**: Mid-level priorities for standard business rules
- **Priority 6-10**: Lower priorities for general rules and defaults
- **Default Handling**: System behavior when no specific rules match

**Priority Assignment Strategy**:
- **Customer-Specific**: Highest priority for negotiated customer pricing
- **Promotional**: High priority for time-sensitive promotional campaigns
- **Volume-Based**: Medium priority for quantity-based pricing rules
- **General**: Lower priority for category or general market pricing

#### Conflict Resolution Logic

**Rule Overlap Management**:
```
Example Conflict Scenario:
Rule A (Priority 1): VIP Customer gets 20% discount
Rule B (Priority 2): Electronics category gets 15% discount
Rule C (Priority 3): Orders over $1000 get 10% discount

Resolution: VIP customer buying electronics over $1000 gets 20% discount (Priority 1 wins)
```

**Combination vs. Override**:
- **Override Logic**: Higher priority rules completely override lower priority rules
- **Additive Logic**: Some rules can be combined for cumulative effects
- **Exclusive Logic**: Certain rules cannot be combined (conflict prevention)
- **Business Logic Validation**: System validation to prevent nonsensical combinations

### Advanced Priority Scenarios

#### Complex Business Rules

**Multi-Dimensional Priority**:
- **Customer + Product**: Combined customer and product-specific rules
- **Time + Volume**: Temporal rules combined with quantity-based rules
- **Geographic + Channel**: Location and sales channel combination rules
- **Contract + Promotion**: Negotiated pricing with promotional overlays

**Exception Handling**:
- **Emergency Pricing**: Highest priority for crisis or emergency situations
- **Management Override**: Special provisions for management pricing decisions
- **System Maintenance**: Pricing behavior during system maintenance or updates
- **Data Validation**: Handling of incomplete or invalid data scenarios
