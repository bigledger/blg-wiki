**Objective**: Configure a multi-tier pricing system for different customer segments

**Customer Story**: MegaDistro serves various customer types from small retailers to large chains, each requiring different pricing structures.

**Step-by-Step Workflow**:

1. **Define Customer Tiers**
   - Navigate to **Sales** â†’ **Customer Management** â†’ **Pricing Tiers**
   - Create tier structure:
     - **Platinum**: Volume >$500k annually, 8% margin, Net 45 terms
     - **Gold**: Volume $200k-500k, 12% margin, Net 30 terms
     - **Silver**: Volume $50k-200k, 16% margin, Net 15 terms
     - **Bronze**: Volume <$50k, 20% margin, Net 10 terms

2. **Configure Volume Breakpoints**
   - Set automatic tier upgrades based on trailing 12-month purchases
   - **Expected Result**: System automatically promotes customers when volume thresholds are met
   - Configure tier benefits:
     - Platinum: Free shipping on orders >$1,000
     - Gold: 2% early payment discount
     - Silver: 1% early payment discount
     - Bronze: Standard terms

3. **Customer-Specific Negotiated Rates**
