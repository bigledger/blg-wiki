# Multi-Path Navigation Architecture for BigLedger Documentation

## Concept: Multiple Perspectives to Same Content
Just like music can be viewed from frequency spectrum or amplitude (time domain), users should reach the same documentation through different mental models and navigation paths.

## Navigation Dimensions

## Implementation Example: Inventory Module

The same Inventory module documentation can be accessed through:

1. **Role Path**: 
   - `/roles/business-users/warehouse-staff/` → Inventory
   - `/roles/partners/implementation/` → Inventory Setup

2. **Function Path**:
   - `/functions/operations/inventory-mgmt/` → Stock Control
   - `/functions/financial/costing/` → Inventory Valuation

3. **Industry Path**:
   - `/industries/retail/merchandising/` → Product Management
   - `/industries/manufacturing/materials/` → Raw Material Inventory

4. **Stage Path**:
   - `/stages/implementation/setup/` → Inventory Configuration
   - `/stages/operations/daily/` → Stock Transactions

5. **Technical Path**:
   - `/technical/backend/database/` → Inventory Tables
   - `/technical/integration/connectors/` → WMS Integration

6. **Solution Path**:
   - `/solutions/efficiency/reduce-errors/` → Barcode Scanning
   - `/solutions/visibility/real-time/` → Stock Levels Dashboard

## Navigation Components

### 1. **Smart Search with Context**
```javascript
// Search understands context and synonyms
"stock" → Shows: Inventory, Products, Stock Take, Warehouse
"payment" → Shows: AP, AR, Banking, POS payments
"customer" → Shows: CRM, Sales, Support, Portal
```

### 2. **Role-Based Homepage**
```yaml
# Different landing pages based on login role
accountant: Shows Finance modules, Reports, Compliance
salesperson: Shows CRM, Orders, Commissions, Targets
developer: Shows API docs, SDKs, Webhooks, Sandbox
```

### 3. **Breadcrumb Alternatives**
```
Current Path: Home > Modules > Inventory > Stock Adjustment

Alternative Paths:
- Home > Functions > Operations > Inventory Management > Adjustments
- Home > Roles > Warehouse Staff > Daily Tasks > Stock Adjustment
- Home > Solutions > Accuracy > Cycle Counting > Adjustment Process
```

### 4. **Related Content Sidebar**
```markdown
## Currently Viewing: Inventory Valuation

### Related by Function:
- Cost of Goods Sold
- Financial Reporting
- Margin Analysis

### Related by Role:
- CFO Dashboard
- Cost Accountant Tasks
- Auditor Checklist

### Related by Process:
- Month-end Closing
- Stock Take Procedure
- Revaluation Journal
```

### 5. **Tag-Based Discovery**
```yaml
tags:
  - compliance    # Links all compliance-related content
  - automation   # Links all automation features
  - integration  # Links all integration points
  - mobile       # Links all mobile-capable features
  - ai-powered   # Links all AI features
```

## Benefits of Multi-Path Navigation

1. **Faster Discovery**: Users find content through their natural mental model
2. **Better Learning**: Multiple contexts reinforce understanding
3. **Reduced Support**: Users self-serve more effectively
4. **Higher Adoption**: Each user type has optimized experience
5. **SEO Advantage**: Multiple paths improve search rankings
