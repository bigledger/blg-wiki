## 1. Inventory Receiving and Putaway Operations

### Scenario-Based Questions:

**Q1.1:** "We received a large shipment from our supplier in China, but the quantity delivered is 500 units short of what's on the purchase order. The driver is waiting for confirmation, and I have a receiving team ready to process. How do I efficiently handle this discrepancy in BigLedger while keeping the receiving dock moving? What documentation do I need for the insurance claim?"

**Q1.2:** "During our morning receiving inspection, we found 200 units of electronic components with water damage - looks like the container had a leak during the monsoon season shipping. These items are time-sensitive for our production line. How do I properly document this in BigLedger, quarantine the damaged goods, and initiate a supplier claim while ensuring we don't disrupt our production schedule?"

**Q1.3:** "I'm expecting 5 different shipments today, but our receiving dock can only handle 2 trucks at a time due to space constraints. One shipment contains temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals that need immediate processing, another has promotional items needed for tomorrow's retail delivery. How do I prioritize receiving and coordinate with suppliers for optimal dock scheduling?"

**Q1.4:** "Our main supplier just delivered only 60% of our order due to their production delays, but I need to maintain minimum stock levels for our retail stores. How do I process this partial delivery in BigLedger, manage the backorder, and coordinate emergency stock from alternate suppliers without creating inventory confusion?"
