## Material Requirements Planning (MRP) Mastery

Having implemented MRP systems from the early days of MRP I to today's advanced MRP II and ERP systems, I've learned that successful MRP is 20% software configuration and 80% data accuracy and discipline.

### MRP Foundation Setup

**Master Production Schedule (MPS) Configuration**
```yaml
MPS Parameters in BigLedger:
Planning Horizon: 52 weeks
Frozen Period: 4 weeks (no changes allowed)
Firm Period: 8 weeks (changes require approval)
Planning Period: 12 weeks (flexible planning)

Time Buckets:
- Weeks 1-4: Daily buckets
- Weeks 5-12: Weekly buckets  
- Weeks 13-52: Monthly buckets
```

**MRP Calculation Logic**
```
Net Requirements = Gross Requirements - On Hand - Scheduled Receipts + Safety Stock

Example Product A:
Gross Requirements (Week 5): 1,000 units
On Hand Inventory: 150 units
Scheduled Receipts: 300 units (Week 3)
Safety Stock: 100 units

Net Requirements = 1,000 - 150 - 300 + 100 = 650 units
```

### Advanced MRP Parameters

**Lead Time Management**
```yaml
Lead Time Components:
Manufacturing Lead Time:
  Queue Time: 2 days (waiting for production)
  Setup Time: 0.5 days (machine setup)
  Run Time: 3 days (actual production)
  Wait Time: 1 day (cooling/drying)
  Move Time: 0.5 days (transportation)
  Total: 7 days

Purchase Lead Time:
  Processing Time: 1 day (PO creation/approval)
  Vendor Lead Time: 14 days (supplier delivery)
  Receiving Time: 1 day (inspection/put-away)
  Total: 16 days
```

**Safety Stock Calculation**
```
Statistical Safety Stock Formula:
SS = Z × σ × √LT

Where:
Z = Service level factor (95% = 1.645)
σ = Standard deviation of demand
LT = Lead time in periods

Example:
Service Level: 95% (Z = 1.645)
Demand Std Dev: 50 units/week
Lead Time: 3 weeks

Safety Stock = 1.645 × 50 × √3 = 142 units
```

### MRP Action Messages

**Critical Action Message Types**
```
Action Messages in BigLedger:
1. "Expedite" - Move in planned order receipt
2. "De-expedite" - Move out planned order receipt
3. "Increase Qty" - Increase planned order quantity
4. "Decrease Qty" - Decrease planned order quantity
5. "Cancel" - Cancel planned order
6. "Release" - Convert planned order to firm order
```

**Action Message Processing Workflow**
```
Daily MRP Review Process:
1. Run MRP regeneration (overnight batch)
2. Generate exception reports
3. Review action messages by planner
4. Validate capacity constraints
5. Process high-priority actions first
6. Update planning parameters if needed
7. Communicate changes to production
```

### Multi-Level BOM Explosion

**BOM Explosion Example**
```
Product: Bicycle (End Item)
Level 0: Bicycle (1 each)
├── Level 1: Frame Assembly (1 each)
│   ├── Level 2: Frame Tubing (1 each)
│   ├── Level 2: Welding Materials (0.5 kg)
│   └── Level 2: Paint (0.2 liters)
├── Level 1: Wheel Assembly (2 each)
│   ├── Level 2: Rim (1 each)
│   ├── Level 2: Spokes (36 each)
│   ├── Level 2: Hub (1 each)
│   └── Level 2: Tire (1 each)
└── Level 1: Component Kit (1 each)
    ├── Level 2: Chain (1 each)
    ├── Level 2: Gears (21 each)
    └── Level 2: Brake Assembly (2 each)

MRP Explosion Calculation:
If planning 100 bicycles:
- Frame Tubing: 100 × 1 = 100 each
- Spokes: 100 × 2 × 36 = 7,200 each
- Gears: 100 × 1 × 21 = 2,100 each
```

### Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP)

**Work Center Capacity Definition**
```yaml
Work Center: CNC Machine Center
Available Capacity:
  Shifts: 2 shifts/day
  Hours per Shift: 8 hours
  Days per Week: 5 days
  Efficiency: 85%
  Utilization: 90%

Theoretical Capacity: 2 × 8 × 5 = 80 hours/week
Available Capacity: 80 × 0.85 × 0.90 = 61.2 hours/week
```

**Capacity Load Calculation**
```
Load Calculation Example:
Work Order WO-001:
- Quantity: 500 units
- Setup Time: 2 hours
- Run Time: 0.5 hours/unit
- Total Load: 2 + (500 × 0.5) = 252 hours

Weekly Capacity Planning:
Week 15: Available 61.2 hours, Loaded 58.5 hours ✓ OK
Week 16: Available 61.2 hours, Loaded 75.2 hours ✗ Overload
Week 17: Available 61.2 hours, Loaded 45.3 hours ✓ OK
```

## Bill of Materials (BOM) Management Excellence

BOM accuracy is the foundation of manufacturing success. In my experience, companies with BOM accuracy below 95% struggle with material shortages, excess inventory, and production delays.

### BOM Structure Design

**Multi-Level BOM Hierarchy**
```
BOM Structure Types:
1. Manufacturing BOM (M-BOM)
   - Used for production planning
   - Includes manufacturing steps
   - Reflects assembly sequence

2. Engineering BOM (E-BOM)
   - Design-centric view
   - Component specifications
   - Engineering change control

3. Service BOM (S-BOM)
   - Field service parts
   - Replacement components
   - Maintenance items
```

**Phantom vs. Regular BOMs**
```yaml
Regular BOM - Wheel Assembly:
  Item: WHEEL-001
  Make/Buy: Make
  Lead Time: 3 days
  Components:
    - Rim: 1 each
    - Spokes: 36 each
    - Hub: 1 each

Phantom BOM - Paint Kit:
  Item: PAINT-KIT (Phantom)
  Make/Buy: Phantom
  Lead Time: 0 days
  Components:
    - Base Paint: 0.8 liters
    - Hardener: 0.2 liters
    - Thinner: 0.1 liters
```

### BOM Versioning and Change Control

**Engineering Change Order (ECO) Process**
```
ECO Workflow:
1. Change Request Initiated
   - Requestor: Engineering/Quality/Production
   - Reason: Design improvement/Cost reduction/Regulatory
   - Impact Analysis: Cost/Schedule/Quality

2. Change Evaluation
   - Technical review
   - Cost analysis
   - Implementation timing
   - Obsolete inventory handling

3. Approval Process
   - Engineering approval
   - Manufacturing approval
   - Quality approval
   - Customer approval (if required)

4. Implementation
   - BOM version update
   - Effectivity date setting
   - Training execution
   - System updates
```

**BOM Effectivity Management**
```
BOM Version Control Example:
Product: Widget A
Current Version: Rev C (Effective: 01-Jan-2024)
Previous Version: Rev B (Effective: 01-Jun-2023 to 31-Dec-2023)

Revision Changes:
Rev B to Rev C:
- Component X123: Removed
- Component Y456: Added (Replacement for X123)
- Component Z789: Quantity changed from 2 to 3
- Labor Operation 30: Time reduced from 15 to 12 minutes
```

### Alternative Components and Substitutions

**Substitute Component Setup**
```yaml
Primary Component: Screw-A-001
Alternatives:
  - Substitute 1:
      Item: Screw-B-002
      Substitution Ratio: 1:1
      Priority: 1
      Effectivity: Always
  
  - Substitute 2:
      Item: Screw-C-003
      Substitution Ratio: 1:2
      Priority: 2
      Effectivity: When Primary unavailable

Automatic Substitution Rules:
- Use primary component if available
- If primary < safety stock, check substitute 1
- If substitute 1 unavailable, use substitute 2
- Alert planner of substitution
```

### Co-Products and By-Products

**Process Manufacturing BOM Example**
```yaml
Process: Chemical Reaction A
Input Materials:
  - Chemical A: 100 kg
  - Chemical B: 50 kg
  - Catalyst: 2 kg

Output Products:
  - Main Product: 120 kg (80% yield)
  - Co-Product: 25 kg (valuable secondary product)
  - By-Product: 5 kg (minimal value)
  - Waste: 2 kg (disposal cost)

Cost Allocation:
Main Product: 75% of total cost
Co-Product: 20% of total cost
By-Product: 3% of total cost
Waste: 2% of total cost
```

### BOM Costing and Analysis

**Cost Roll-up Calculation**
```
BOM Cost Analysis - Assembly A:
Material Costs:
  Component 1: MYR 25.00
  Component 2: MYR 15.50
  Component 3: MYR 8.75
  Total Material: MYR 49.25

Labor Costs:
  Operation 10: 0.5 hours × MYR 30/hour = MYR 15.00
  Operation 20: 0.3 hours × MYR 25/hour = MYR 7.50
  Total Labor: MYR 22.50

Overhead Costs:
  Variable Overhead: 1.5 hours × MYR 20/hour = MYR 30.00
  Fixed Overhead: 1.5 hours × MYR 15/hour = MYR 22.50
  Total Overhead: MYR 52.50

Total Standard Cost: MYR 124.25
```

## Production Planning and Scheduling

Effective production planning balances customer demand with manufacturing capacity while minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency.

### Master Production Schedule (MPS)

**MPS Planning Process**
```
MPS Development Steps:
1. Demand Aggregation
   - Sales forecasts
   - Customer orders
   - Service parts demand
   - Inter-plant transfers

2. Resource Validation
   - Capacity constraints
   - Material availability
   - Tooling requirements
   - Skilled labor availability

3. Schedule Optimization
   - Lot sizing optimization
   - Setup minimization
   - Capacity utilization
   - Due date performance
```

**MPS Example Table**
```
Master Production Schedule - Product Family A
Week:     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
Forecast: 100  120  110  130  125  140  135  150
Orders:   95   85   65   45   25   10   5    0
MPS:      100  120  110  130  125  140  135  150

Available to Promise (ATP):
Week 1: 100 - 95 = 5 units
Week 2: 120 - 85 = 35 units
Week 3: 110 - 65 = 45 units
```

### Finite vs. Infinite Capacity Scheduling

**Infinite Capacity Scheduling**
```
Characteristics:
- Assumes unlimited capacity
- Schedules based on lead times
- Identifies capacity overloads
- Requires manual capacity adjustment

Example Output:
Work Center A (Week 5):
Required Hours: 120
Available Hours: 80
Overload: 40 hours (50% over capacity)
```

**Finite Capacity Scheduling**
```
Characteristics:
- Considers actual capacity constraints
- Automatically reschedules when overloaded
- Provides realistic completion dates
- Optimizes resource utilization

Scheduling Logic:
1. Sort orders by priority
2. Schedule highest priority first
3. Check capacity availability
4. If capacity available, schedule
5. If not available, move to next period
6. Continue until all orders scheduled
```

### Advanced Scheduling Techniques

**Theory of Constraints (TOC) Scheduling**
```
TOC Implementation Steps:
1. Identify the Constraint (Bottleneck)
   - Work center with highest utilization
   - Resource limiting overall throughput

2. Exploit the Constraint
   - Maximize constraint utilization
   - Minimize setup time on constraint
   - Ensure constraint never starved

3. Subordinate Everything Else
   - Non-constraints support the constraint
   - Buffer before constraint
   - Manage flow to constraint

4. Elevate the Constraint
   - Add capacity to constraint
   - Improve constraint efficiency
   - Offload work from constraint

Example:
Constraint: Heat Treatment (40 hours/week capacity)
Non-Constraint: Machining (80 hours/week capacity)

Schedule machining to always feed heat treatment
Maintain 2-day buffer before heat treatment
Never let heat treatment sit idle
```

### Campaign and Batch Production

**Campaign Planning for Process Industries**
```yaml
Campaign Schedule - Chemical Plant:
Product A Campaign:
  Duration: 2 weeks
  Batch Size: 5,000 kg
  Batches: 4
  Setup Time: 8 hours
  Cleaning Time: 16 hours

Product B Campaign:
  Duration: 1 week
  Batch Size: 3,000 kg
  Batches: 3
  Setup Time: 4 hours
  Cleaning Time: 12 hours

Campaign Sequence Optimization:
1. Minimize changeover times
2. Group similar products
3. Consider shelf life constraints
4. Balance inventory levels
```

### Production Scheduling Optimization

**Genetic Algorithm for Job Shop Scheduling**
```
Optimization Parameters:
Objectives:
  1. Minimize total completion time (makespan)
  2. Minimize total tardiness
  3. Maximize resource utilization
  4. Minimize work-in-process inventory

Constraints:
  1. Precedence constraints (operation sequence)
  2. Resource capacity constraints
  3. Due date constraints
  4. Material availability constraints

Example Results:
Original Schedule: 15 days completion
Optimized Schedule: 12 days completion
Improvement: 20% reduction in makespan
```

## Work-in-Progress Tracking

Accurate WIP tracking is essential for cost control, capacity planning, and customer delivery promises.

### WIP Valuation Methods

**Standard Costing WIP Valuation**
```
Work Order: WO-2024-001
Product: Assembly X
Quantity: 100 units

Standard Costs:
Material: MYR 50/unit
Labor: MYR 30/unit
Overhead: MYR 40/unit
Total Standard: MYR 120/unit

WIP Calculation by Operation:
Operation 10 (50% complete): MYR 25/unit
Operation 20 (100% complete): MYR 30/unit
Operation 30 (75% complete): MYR 30/unit
Operation 40 (0% complete): MYR 0/unit
Total WIP Value: MYR 85/unit × 100 units = MYR 8,500
```

**Actual Costing WIP Valuation**
```
Actual Costs Incurred:
Materials Issued: MYR 5,200
Labor Hours: 80 hours × MYR 32/hour = MYR 2,560
Overhead Applied: 80 hours × MYR 38/hour = MYR 3,040
Total Actual WIP: MYR 10,800

Completion Percentage: 70%
Expected Total Cost: MYR 10,800 ÷ 0.70 = MYR 15,429
Variance from Standard: MYR 15,429 - MYR 12,000 = MYR 3,429 unfavorable

## Inventory Valuation Methods Deep Dive

Inventory valuation significantly impacts financial statements, tax obligations, and operational decisions.

### FIFO (First-In, First-Out) Implementation

**FIFO Calculation Example**
```
Inventory Transactions - Product A:
Jan 1:  Beginning balance: 100 units @ MYR 10 = MYR 1,000
Jan 5:  Purchase: 200 units @ MYR 12 = MYR 2,400
Jan 10: Sale: 150 units
Jan 15: Purchase: 100 units @ MYR 15 = MYR 1,500
Jan 20: Sale: 180 units
Jan 25: Purchase: 50 units @ MYR 16 = MYR 800

FIFO Cost of Goods Sold:
Jan 10 Sale (150 units):
  100 units @ MYR 10 = MYR 1,000
  50 units @ MYR 12 = MYR 600
  Total COGS: MYR 1,600

Jan 20 Sale (180 units):
  150 units @ MYR 12 = MYR 1,800
  30 units @ MYR 15 = MYR 450
  Total COGS: MYR 2,250

Ending Inventory:
  70 units @ MYR 15 = MYR 1,050
  50 units @ MYR 16 = MYR 800
  Total Ending Inventory: MYR 1,850
```

### Weighted Average Cost Implementation

**Moving Average Calculation**
```
Moving Average Method - Product B:
Date    Transaction    Qty   Unit Cost   Total    Avg Cost
Jan 1   Beginning      50    MYR 20     MYR 1,000  MYR 20.00
Jan 3   Purchase       30    MYR 22     MYR 660

### Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) Implementation

**LCM Assessment Process**
```yaml
LCM Analysis - Product D:
Historical Cost: MYR 50/unit
Current Market Price: MYR 45/unit
Replacement Cost: MYR 43/unit
Net Realizable Value: MYR 48/unit
Net Realizable Value - Normal Profit: MYR 42/unit

LCM Calculation:
Market Value = Middle value of:
  - Replacement Cost: MYR 43
  - Net Realizable Value: MYR 48
  - NRV - Normal Profit: MYR 42
  Market Value = MYR 43

LCM = Lower of Cost (MYR 50) or Market (MYR 43)
LCM = MYR 43/unit

Inventory Write-down:
Write-down per unit: MYR 50 - MYR 43 = MYR 7
Inventory on hand: 200 units
Total write-down: MYR 1,400

Journal Entry:
Dr. Inventory Write-down Expense       MYR 1,400
    Cr. Inventory Valuation Allowance        MYR 1,400

## Cycle Counting and Physical Inventory Excellence

Inventory accuracy is the foundation of effective operations. My target is 95%+ accuracy, achievable with proper cycle counting procedures.

### Cycle Counting Program Design

**ABC Classification for Cycle Counting**
```
ABC Analysis Based on Annual Usage Value:
Class A Items (70% of value, 20% of items):
  - Count frequency: Weekly or bi-weekly
  - Tolerance: ±2%
  - Immediate investigation of variances
  - Root cause analysis required

Class B Items (20% of value, 30% of items):
  - Count frequency: Monthly
  - Tolerance: ±5%
  - Variance investigation if significant
  - Quarterly trend analysis

Class C Items (10% of value, 50% of items):
  - Count frequency: Quarterly
  - Tolerance: ±10%
  - Focus on major variances only
  - Annual procedure review
```

**Cycle Count Schedule Planning**
```yaml
Daily Cycle Count Plan:
Monday:
  - A items: Locations A001-A050
  - High-velocity items
  - Previous variance follow-up

Tuesday:
  - A items: Locations A051-A100
  - B items: Locations B001-B025
  - Customer return areas

Wednesday:
  - A items: Locations A101-A150
  - B items: Locations B026-B050
  - Work-in-process areas

Thursday:
  - A items: Locations A151-A200
  - C items: Locations C001-C100
  - Consignment inventory

Friday:
  - Variance resolution
  - Root cause analysis
  - Process improvements
  - Next week planning
```

### Count Procedures and Controls

**Pre-Count Preparation**
```
Preparation Checklist:
□ Freeze inventory transactions during count
□ Complete all pending receipts and issues
□ Organize counting areas
□ Prepare count sheets/mobile devices
□ Assign counting teams
□ Review procedures with counters
□ Verify scales and measuring equipment
□ Identify problem areas from previous counts
```

**Counting Process Controls**
```
Blind Count Procedures:
1. Generate count sheets without quantities
2. Assign counters to unfamiliar areas
3. Require independent second counts for variances
4. Use different teams for recounts
5. Supervisor spot checks of 10% of counts
6. Document all unusual situations

Count Team Structure:
Primary Counter: Physical counting
Secondary Counter: Independent verification  
Recorder: Data entry and documentation
Supervisor: Quality control and exception handling
```

### Variance Investigation Process

**Variance Analysis Workflow**
```
Variance Investigation Steps:
1. Immediate Verification
   - Recount suspected variances
   - Check for recent transactions
   - Verify unit of measure
   - Confirm product identification

2. Transaction Review
   - Review recent receipts/issues
   - Check for timing differences
   - Verify posting dates
   - Investigate unposted transactions

3. Physical Investigation
   - Check alternate locations
   - Look for damaged products
   - Verify lot/serial numbers
   - Check for misidentified items

4. Root Cause Analysis
   - Identify cause category
   - Document contributing factors
   - Assign responsibility
   - Develop corrective actions

5. Adjustment Processing
   - Supervisor approval required
   - Document business justification
   - Process inventory adjustment
   - Update cycle count results
```

**Common Variance Root Causes**
```
Root Cause Categories:
Transaction Errors (40%):
  - Incorrect quantities posted
  - Wrong location updates
  - Timing differences
  - Missed transactions

Physical Handling (30%):
  - Damaged goods not recorded
  - Theft or shrinkage
  - Incorrect put-away location
  - Product deterioration

System Issues (20%):
  - Unit of measure errors
  - Product code mix-ups
