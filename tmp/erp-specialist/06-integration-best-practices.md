**Intelligent Matching Algorithms**
```yaml
Transaction Matching Rules:
Exact Matching (Priority 1):
  - Amount exactly matches
  - Reference number matches
  - Date within tolerance (±3 days)
  - Account number verification
  - Currency confirmation

Amount Matching (Priority 2):
  - Amount matches within tolerance
  - Date range matching
  - Payee/payor similarity
  - Multiple transactions combination
  - Partial payment identification

Pattern Matching (Priority 3):
  - Recurring transaction patterns
  - Historical matching behavior
  - Vendor payment patterns
  - Customer receipt patterns
  - Standing instruction matching

Machine Learning Enhancement:
Algorithm Training:
  - Historical matching decisions
  - User override patterns
  - Seasonal adjustments
  - Client-specific rules
  - Continuous improvement

Confidence Scoring:
  High Confidence (>95%): Auto-match
  Medium Confidence (80-95%): Suggest match
  Low Confidence (<80%): Manual review
  
Example Matching Logic:
Bank Transaction: MYR 15,000 from "ABC TRADING"
BigLedger Transactions:
1. Invoice #INV-2024-001: MYR 15,000 from ABC Trading Sdn Bhd
   Confidence: 98% - Auto-match
   
2. Invoice #INV-2024-002: MYR 15,500 from ABC Company
   Confidence: 75% - Manual review
   
3. Multiple invoices totaling MYR 15,000
   Confidence: 85% - Suggest match
```
