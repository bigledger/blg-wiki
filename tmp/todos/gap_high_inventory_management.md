# Content Gap: Complete Inventory Management Documentation

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days  
**Impact**: Core ERP functionality missing  

## Problem Statement

The extracted Confluence data contains 10 comprehensive pages about inventory management features, but the current documentation only provides basic module overview. This is a critical gap as inventory management is a core ERP function that many businesses depend on.

## Available Confluence Content

### Pages to Integrate:

5. **Stock_Balance_Applet.md** - Stock balance management
6. **Stock_Balance_Tab.md** - Interface details
7. **Stock_Availability_Tab.md** - Availability tracking
8. **Internal_Stock_Adjustment_Applet.md** - Adjustment procedures
9. **Related_Applets_-_Stock_Balance.md** - Integration information
10. **Related_Applets_-_Internal_Stock_Adjustment.md** - Related functionality

### Key Content Areas Missing:
- Stock take procedures and configurations
- Internal stock adjustment workflows
- Stock balance monitoring and reporting
- Warehouse operations and management
- Inventory transfer procedures
- Integration with other modules (POS, Accounting, etc.)
- Real-time stock tracking and alerts

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1**:

## Priority within High Priority

This should be tackled immediately after EcomSync integration because:
1. **Broader Impact**: More customers use inventory than e-commerce features
2. **Foundation**: Many other modules depend on inventory data
3. **Confluence Content Volume**: 10 pages of existing content to leverage
4. **Business Critical**: Inventory accuracy is fundamental to business operations

## Notes

The inventory management documentation gap represents one of the largest content opportunities. The Confluence content provides excellent foundation material, but we need to ensure it's organized for different user types and includes modern warehouse best practices.
