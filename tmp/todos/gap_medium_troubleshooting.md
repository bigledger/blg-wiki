# Content Gap: Comprehensive Troubleshooting Documentation

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Impact**: Reduces support burden, improves user self-service  

## Problem Statement

The current documentation lacks comprehensive troubleshooting guides that would help users resolve common issues independently. While the POS module has some troubleshooting content, most modules have no problem-solving guidance. The Confluence data contains some troubleshooting content that should be expanded and systematized.

## Available Confluence Content

### Troubleshooting-Related Pages:
1. **100_Troubleshooting_and_FAQs.md** - EcomSync troubleshooting
2. Various applet pages contain scattered troubleshooting information
3. Error handling information embedded in feature documentation

### Missing Troubleshooting Areas:
- System-wide error codes and messages
- Module-specific common issues
- Performance optimization guidance
- Data consistency problems
- Integration failure troubleshooting
- User permission and access issues
