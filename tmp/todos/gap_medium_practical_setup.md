# Content Gap: Practical Setup and Implementation Guides

**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Impact**: Critical for new user onboarding and customer success  

## Problem Statement

The current documentation lacks comprehensive, step-by-step implementation guides that new customers can follow to get BigLedger up and running. While module documentation exists, there's no clear path from "empty system" to "productive business operations." The Confluence data contains valuable setup content that needs to be integrated and enhanced.

## Available Confluence Content

### Setup-Related Pages:
1. **Company_-_Organization_Applet.md** - Company and organizational setup
2. **Branch_-_Organization_Applet.md** - Multi-branch configuration  
3. **Location_-_Organization_Applet.md** - Location management
4. **Settings_of_Organization_Applet.md** - Organizational settings
5. **Installation.md** - General installation guidance
6. **Accounting.md** - Contains company setup procedures

### Key Setup Areas Missing:
- Complete implementation roadmap
- Step-by-step company setup wizard
- User management and permissions setup
- Module activation and configuration sequence
- Data migration procedures
- Go-live checklist and procedures

- Develop company setup guide from Confluence content
- Begin user management and security documentation

**Week 2**:
- Complete module activation guide
- Create data migration procedures
- Develop go-live and best practices content

**Week 3**:
- Review and validation with implementation team
- Add templates, checklists, and tools
- Integration with existing module documentation

## Integration with Existing Content

This implementation guide should:
- Reference and link to detailed module documentation
- Provide overview with links to detailed procedures
- Include industry-specific considerations
- Connect to troubleshooting and support resources

## Notes

Practical setup guides are essential for customer success and reducing support burden. The content should be action-oriented with clear steps, realistic timelines, and practical examples. This bridges the gap between high-level product documentation and detailed technical procedures.
