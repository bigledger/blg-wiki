# Lane 4 findings

Folders: inventory-workflow, master-data
Run: 2026-09-05 — 6 pages completed (doc-item-maintenance, customer-maintenance, chart-of-account, cashbook, stock-availability, stock-adjustment). 35 left in queue.

## Cross-lane link requests

Add `doc-item-maintenance-applet` to `related_applets` of (with one sentence each):
- content/en/applets/integrations/t2t-admin-applet.md — "T2T Item Mapping on the item needs the tenant permission granted here first."
- content/en/applets/sales-workflow/pos-general-applet.md — "Items, item types, pricing schemes and branch/company visibility come from Doc Item Maintenance; POS settings choose which pricing scheme is retail / min / max."
- content/en/applets/ecommerce/cp-commerce-admin-applet.md — "Categories, category images, attributes, search filters, reviews and pages are maintained on the item in Doc Item Maintenance."
- content/en/applets/membership/voucher-management-applet.md — "Voucher-type items (`COUPON`) are created in Doc Item Maintenance."
- content/en/applets/e-invoice/my-e-invoice-portal-applet.md — "Item classification, taxable type code and e-Invoice UOM are captured per item on the E-Invoice tab of Doc Item Maintenance; tenant defaults `DEFAULT_EINVOICE_*` pre-fill them."

Add `customer-maintenance-applet` to `related_applets` of:
- content/en/applets/sales-workflow/internal-sales-order-applet.md and internal-sales-invoice-applet.md — and state how the customer's credit term / credit limit and `BLACKLISTED` credit status are applied when the customer is selected (lane 4 could NOT find credit-limit enforcement in javasdk domain code for sales documents; only in file-import helpers. Please confirm from the sales-document UI/backend.)
- content/en/applets/finance/accounts-receivable-applet.md, statement-of-account-applet.md — customer master link.
- content/en/applets/e-invoice/my-e-invoice-portal-applet.md — "Buyer block (TIN, ID, SST, address, contact, skip-e-Invoice flag) comes from the customer's E-Invoice tab."

Add `chart-of-account-applet` to `related_applets` of:
- content/en/applets/finance/general-ledger-applet.md and ledger-and-journal-applet.md — state the lock rule: manual journal creation is refused (HTTP 403 `FISCAL_PERIOD_LOCKED`, "The selected date falls within a locked fiscal period") when the period is `LOCK_GL` or `LOCK_ALL`; journals with `auto_flag = AUTO` bypass. `LOCK_TXN` does not stop journals. [akaun-api JournalController.java L123-135]
- content/en/applets/finance/financial-report-applet.md — closing-stock lines are switched by `SHOW_INVENTORY/RAW_MATERIAL/WIP/FINISHED_GOODS/NSTI_STOCK_VALUE` under Chart of Account > Settings > General Settings.

Add `cashbook-applet` to `related_applets` of:
- content/en/applets/finance/bank-reconciliation-applet.md — reconciles one cashbook.
- content/en/applets/finance/internal-receipt-voucher-applet.md, internal-payment-voucher-applet.md — settlement method → cashbook → GL code; bank charges post via the settlement method's Charges tab and the `SETTLEMENT_CHARGES` default GL code.
- content/en/applets/sales-workflow/pos-general-applet.md — per-branch default settlement method per tender type lives in Cashbook > Settings > Branch Settings.
- content/en/applets/finance/general-ledger-applet.md — cash transfer journals are created only for `FINAL` transfers (Dr *to* cashbook GL, Cr *from* cashbook GL).

Add `stock-availability-applet` to `related_applets` of:
- content/en/applets/sales-workflow/internal-sales-order-applet.md, purchase-workflow/internal-purchase-order-applet.md, internal-purchase-grn-applet.md — open documents of these types are the "Adj Qty" that reduce / increase Available Qty (Available = Stock Balance + signed Adj Qty).

Add `stock-adjustment-applet` to `related_applets` of:
- content/en/applets/finance/general-ledger-applet.md — stock adjustment journal rule: Adjust-Out (qty < 0) debits the `STOCK_ADJUSTMENT` account (or the line's own GL code), Adjust-In credits it; stock side via `COGS` / stock balance mapping. [JournalPostingTypeHandler L104-109, JournalPostingService L93-160]

Within lane 4 (to do on later pages): add back-links to the six completed pages from inv-item-maintenance, tax-configuration, organisation, stock-balance, stock-take, stock-reservation, warehouse-management, pricebook, supplier-applet-1, employee, entity, merchant when those pages are processed.

## Registry / naming mismatches

- **Two wiki pages for one registry row.** `customer_applet_v1` "Customer Maintenance" (documentation_url → /applets/customer-maintenance-applet/) is documented by BOTH content/en/applets/master-data/customer-maintenance-applet.md (now rewritten, canonical) and content/en/applets/master-data/customer-applet.md ("Customer Applet"). The latter invents a "front desk vs back office" distinction that does not exist — both describe blg-applet-akaun-platform-customer-applet. Recommendation: merge customer-applet.md into customer-maintenance-applet.md and keep `/applets/master-data/customer-applet/` as an alias. Lane 4 will mark customer-applet.md skipped when it reaches it unless told otherwise.
- `customerprofileapplet` "Customer Profile" (TNT-APPLET, ACTIVE, created 2025-09-25) has no wiki page and no repo found under a matching slug in refs/. Not the customer-specific beauty/CMZ profile applets. Needs a decision: document or exclude.
- `erp_stock_adjustment_applet` has two repos: blg-applet-wavelet-stock-adjustment-applet (current, last commit 2026-08-24) and blg-applet-akaun-platform-stock-adjustment-applet (2025-11 split, dormant). Page uses the wavelet repo.
- `cashbookApplet` "Cashbook Applet" is DELETED; the live row is `cashbook-applet` "Cashbook".
- Titles changed to registry names: "Doc Item Maintenance Applet" → "Doc Item Maintenance"; "Customer Maintenance Applet" → "Customer Maintenance"; "Chart of Account Applet" → "Chart of Account"; "Cashbook Applet" → "Cashbook"; "Stock Availability Applet" → "Stock Availability"; "Stock Adjustment Applet" → "Stock Adjustment (Internal)". Nav labels change accordingly.

## Undocumented applets encountered

- `customerprofileapplet` — Customer Profile (see above).
- `AkaunPriceBookApplet` "Akaun Price Book" (ACTIVE 2025-11-13) — may or may not be what pricebook-applet.md (queued) describes; resolve when that page is processed.

## Questions for Vincent

1. Merge customer-applet.md into customer-maintenance-applet.md (same registry row)? Or is "Customer Applet" meant to describe `customerprofileapplet`?
2. Credit limit enforcement: the old customer pages claim the system "hard-stops" a sales order over the limit. Not found in javasdk domain code for sales documents. Which lane/page should verify and own that statement?
3. Doc Item Maintenance previously embedded a YouTube video via inline-styled `<div><iframe>` (violates the Hextra rule). Replaced with `{{< youtube omcu01BQTFs >}}`. OK to keep the video?
4. Unbound settings screens: Doc Item "Department Settings", Chart of Account "Field Settings", Stock Adjustment "Field Settings" show toggles with no form binding (no effect). Documented as "no effect". Report to the applet team as UI bugs?
5. Stock Adjustment lifecycle: documented DRAFT / FINAL / DISCARDED only. The previous page listed VOID; no VOID path found in GenericDocumentService this pass. Can stock adjustments be voided?

## Notes

- **The HIDE_/SHOW_ pattern is universal.** Every applet in this lane stores a tenant-wide settings JSON of `HIDE_*` switches (menus, tabs, columns, fields) and registers matching `SHOW_*` client-side permissions in `bl_applet_client_side_perm_dfn`; a permission re-enables the feature for its holder (`visible = !HIDE_setting || SHOW_permission`). Doc Item has ~300 keys; Customer 35 permissions; Stock Availability 50; Chart of Account none.
- **Master data is shared across applets more than the wiki implied.** Category groups/categories are shared between Doc Item and Inventory Item Maintenance; customer, supplier, employee and merchant are one entity table; a settlement method is stored as a financial item of type `STL_MTHD` (which is why it can leak into item pickers — gt#7616).
- **Posting rules live in two Java places.** Document-type → sub-ledger mapping in `JournalPostingTypeHandler`; debit/credit direction in `JournalPostingService`; fiscal locks in `JournalController` (LOCK_GL/LOCK_ALL for manual journals, AUTO journals exempt) and `GenericDocumentService` (LOCK_TXN/LOCK_ALL for documents).
- **Defect candidates found while reading code** (recorded in kb/topics, not fixed): customer create form binds phone `[required]="NOT_MANDATORY_PHONE_NO"` (inverted vs the edit form); Stock Availability listing pricing-lateral performance (gt#8633, fixed); cash transfer idempotency counting DELETED journals (gt#9120, fixed).
- Privacy: issues referenced by number only; customer/tenant/person names in issue titles dropped.
- Process: `book.py` (scratchpad) appends the ledger record and moves queue→done; two ledger records initially had empty `sources` because of a cwd slip and were repaired.
