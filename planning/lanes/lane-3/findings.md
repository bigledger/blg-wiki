# Lane 3 findings

Folders: purchase-workflow, ecommerce, e-invoice, delivery-installation, external-tenant-admin

## Cross-lane link requests

- **sales-workflow/internal-sales-debit-note-applet.md** (lane owning sales-workflow): add `internal-purchase-debit-note-applet` to `related_applets`. Its "Core Concept" callout says the auto-created Purchase Debit Note makes the buyer "owe +RM 500"; the backend posts the Purchase Debit Note as Dr Creditor / Cr Purchase (amount signum +1), i.e. the buyer's payable goes *down*. Please soften that claim to "creates a matching Purchase Debit Note (Internal) in the buying company" until the question below is answered.
- **finance/internal-purchase-invoice-applet.md**, **finance/internal-payment-voucher-applet.md**, **finance/creditor-report-applet.md**: add `internal-purchase-debit-note-applet` to `related_applets` (Search Document pulls PI lines; PDN and PV are the two settlement doc types against PIs in PurchaseReportUow).
- **master-data/chart-of-account-applet.md**, **master-data/doc-item-maintenance-applet.md**, **master-data/tax-configuration-applet.md**, **master-data/supplier-applet-1.md**, **master-data/organisation-applet.md**: add `internal-purchase-debit-note-applet` to `related_applets`.

- **sales-workflow/internal-sales-credit-note-applet.md**: add `internal-purchase-credit-note-applet` to `related_applets` (intercompany SCN → PCN pairing in IntercompanyProcessingService).
- **purchase-workflow/supplier-delivery-order-applet.md** (this lane, later in queue) and **finance/internal-purchase-invoice-applet.md**, **finance/internal-payment-voucher-applet.md**, **finance/creditor-report-applet.md**, master-data pages listed above: also add `internal-purchase-credit-note-applet`.

- **sales-workflow/internal-sales-order-applet.md**: add `internal-purchase-order-applet` to `related_applets` (intercompany PO ↔ SO pairing).
- **finance/internal-purchase-invoice-applet.md**, **master-data/pricebook-applet.md**, **master-data/workflow-design-applet.md**, **master-data/employee-applet.md**: add `internal-purchase-order-applet` (PI knocks off PO lines; pricing schemes; workflow; designations for approval).

- **sales-workflow/internal-sales-return-applet.md**: add `internal-purchase-return-applet` (intercompany PR ↔ SR pairing).
- **master-data/inv-item-maintenance-applet.md**, **finance/internal-purchase-invoice-applet.md**, **finance/internal-payment-voucher-applet.md**, **finance/creditor-report-applet.md**: add `internal-purchase-return-applet`.

## Registry / naming mismatches

- None for the four pages processed: all had ACTIVE registry rows. Titles corrected to the registry names (dropped the trailing " Applet"): Purchase Debit Note (Internal), Purchase Credit Note (Internal), Purchase Order (Internal), Purchase Return (Internal).
- Registry `documentation_url` for `internal_purchase_debit_note_applet` still points at the old Confluence page rather than the wiki (not a page problem; for the parity check / product-side update).

## Undocumented applets encountered

- `internalconsignmentGRNApplet` — "Consignment GRN Applet (Internal)", ACTIVE, has no wiki page under purchase-workflow (the queue has `internal-consignment-return-applet.md`, whose registry row I have not resolved yet).
- `Buyer - Delivery Order`, `Supplier - Delivery Order`, `Transporter- Delivery Order` (CORE1 revision rows) — ACTIVE, no pages; unclear whether they are live applets or legacy CORE1 stubs.

## Questions for Vincent

- **Purchase Debit Note posting direction.** Code: `InternalPurchaseDebitNoteDataConsistencyObject` fixes amount signum **+1**, so `JournalPostingService` posts Dr Creditor / Cr Purchase (AP down), and `PurchaseReportUow` lists `INTERNAL_PURCHASE_DEBIT_NOTE` next to `INTERNAL_PAYMENT_VOUCHER` as settlement against purchase invoices. Purchase Credit Note is **−1** (AP up, same side as an invoice). The old wiki pages said the opposite for both. I rewrote the PDN page to match the code. Please confirm this is the intended product semantics (buyer-issued notes) before the PCN page is rewritten the same way.
- **Intercompany mirror signs.** `IntercompanyProcessingService` pairs Sales Debit Note (+1, AR up) → Purchase Debit Note (+1, AP down) and Sales Credit Note (−1, AR down) → Purchase Credit Note (−1, AP up). The pairs are name-matched but financially opposite. Bug, or intended? This decides what the sales-side pages may claim.

## Notes

- Coordinator instruction (2026-09-05) for the e-invoice pages (my-e-invoice-admin, my-e-invoice-portal, mypeppol-admin, e-invoice/website-builder/user-permission-manager): read `refs/blg-intranet/content/1100-malaysia-einvoice/` and the ~560 blg-intranet e-invoice issues first; internal source — facts only, anonymised, images checked before reuse. Recorded in state.json `notes` so the next run applies it; not reached in this run.

- Applet UI repos reference `projects/shared-utilities` as a git submodule that is *not* checked out inside each applet clone; the shared settings screen (`FieldConfigurationComponent`, 8,300-line template) lives in `/home/marketing/repos/refs/blg-shared-utilities`. Settings toggles there are labelled by their key, so the wiki uses the key as the setting name.
- The five `SHOW_GENDOC_*_BUTTON` / `SHOW_CLONE_BUTTON` / `SHOW_FILE_IMPORT_MENU` client-side permissions are checked by the purchase-side applet code but are not seeded in `bl_applet_client_side_perm_dfn` for `internal_purchase_debit_note_applet`; the page tells admins to create them.
