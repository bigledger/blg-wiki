Please create sub-agents to execute tasks, so that you can run them in the background.
For example, you will have some agents that will research the other website, and pull and save the content, and some other agents will be looking at the existing content, some will be checking for duplication , typo error, some will ensure the richness of the content, and the flow (like a chief editor, looking at the overall usability of the website). For the parts of the content that you may not have the information, please feel free mark "todo" in the page itself, and indicate what needs to be done.

1) there are many pages with duplicated title, for example: https://wiki.bigledger.com/modules
   you will see "BigLedger Modules" appear twice. Please check and scan all other pages, because i do not have time to check the pages one by one and report to you.
   Please think of ways to avoid this kind of duplicated titles from happening in the future , permanently.

2) When i look at the top menu, what you have in the "BigLedger ERP" is similar to those under "Applications". I think you should rename them to "Modules". We define each module as a group of applets, for example:

   I would like you to re-organize the content, and make it more user friendly. Please study the website of SAP, microsoft dynamics 365, Oracle, Netsuite, Kingdee, Ufida, Odoo, Zoho, extract out the strengths, and incorporate all the good stuff into our website. We may not have some of the features, but we are using this website as a software specifications that the other ai-coding agent, will refer to, when developing the remaining missing modules, the features and the functions. 
    
    
3) if you look at this page https://wiki.bigledger.com/user-guide
    The content is quite abrupt, i just feel it is messy.

4) Given the richness of the whole platform, the developer website got to be really extensive, hence, please study the api documentation of quickbooks, xero, netsuite , SAP Hana, Microsoft Dynamics , Odoo, Zoho etc, and then help me to put in place a very commprehensive guide.
