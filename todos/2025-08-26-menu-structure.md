 There are a lot of inconsistency.

What is really needed, consistently, is to have the same top level menu:

- Industry
  * Follow the current industry
- User Guide
  * We will provide a comprehensive list of user guide here.
- Modules
  * This will refer to the complete list of modules in todos/2025-08-26-typos-and-cleaning.md
- Applets
  * Refer to the list of applets, also listed in todos/2025-08-26-typos-and-cleaning.md
  * We will provide data sheet for each of the applet
- Developers
  * There are different type of developers, those learning bigledger to do the integration, api references, applet developers, developers wanting to learn about bigledger architecture, wanting to do automations etc.
- Search
  * Comprehensive search function
* You can remove the "Github Links" from the top
