# Demo Overview


I would like to write a new menu,  in the wiki website, under the "User Guide".

## Objectives

As we are having a very complex system, with many different applets, settings and configurations, we will be creating a tenant demo-v1 , and we would be creating a certain pre-created demo users / passwords.

## Content under "Demo" menu

We will provide step by step guide, based on the roles of the users... for example:

General Accountanting Processes
- Bank Reconciliation Process
- Month End Processing to Generate Profit and Loss

Treasury related processes
- Budget Module
   - Creating New Budget
   - Generating Monthly Budget Report
- Money Market Deposit (investment
   - From inquiries, roll over of deposits, comparison, interest calculations etc.

Point of Sales related Processes
- Creating Cash sales
- Cancelling Cashsales
- Managing Sales Return
- Promotions etc....

* As  you know, when a users look at the menu, our intention is not to create exhaustively the business processes of the entire system, our objectives is to showcase the capability of the systems, at high level, to the prospective users, so that they become comfortable with our system, and want to buy or use our software.

* I need you to THINK, not just follow the example i gave above, I would like you to help me create a structure / template that users will find it user friendly, when reading the page, and opening another tab in the web browser, to click and login using the demo account, and do the testing, evaluation. 

* You can suggest more topics, and target the audience by industry, that means, you need to help me draft a main page, and clearly direct the users to different industry pages, and then outline different / typical business processes, and then provide the corresponding guide, using the industry keywords.

* Now, this task is going to have at least 2 to 3 level deeps, with multiple sub-pages, hence, I would like you to spin up multiple sub-agents, to ensure that you don't get confused with too long context window.  

* Please do the analysis of the requirement first, and then follow by work breakdown, and then planning on different sub-agent to carry out the task, do not rush, take your time, i don't mind if you take a few hours to complete this, i would like it to be as perfect as possible, must give me a winning demo.
